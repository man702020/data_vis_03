C-goals:  How important are different characters? 

Create one or several visualizations that allow me to accomplish the following tasks: 

I want to understand how important different characters are when considering the show as a whole. 
How many episodes do they appear in? 
How much do they speak (lines or dialogue, or words could be used here).
I want to be able to select a character and see:
Which episodes did they appear in?  What seasons do they appear in?
How much did they speak in these episodes/seasons? (You can use lines of dialogue or words)  
Note- you can accomplish these goals using a timeline of episodes, or seasons, or show the seasons in the timeline- up to you. 
I want to be able to select an episode or a season and see:
Which characters appeared in the selected episode or season?
Who spoke most often in the selected episode or season? (You can use lines of dialogue or words)
Optional:
Link out to Wikipedia or other fan pages for a character.
Incorporating an icon or image for that character in your interface.   
Incorporate the theme of the show in your page in some way.  Have fun! 
You can accomplish these goals through a combination of visual representations and interactions.  You can use bar charts, line chars, other appropriate representations, and for interactions you can use details on demand (like tooltips), brushing and linking, user interface elements.  Explain and justify your choices- how your user will accomplish these tasks and why you selected the visualization or interaction approach you chose.   

You can feel free to filter out characters who appear in 1 episode, or characters who are unnamed (guy #2), but recurring characters, or characters with many lines in at least one episode should be present in some way in your interface.  Justify your decisions on who you keep and exclude in your documentation.  

B-goals:  All of the C goals, plus: 

Choose one of the following options.  Your choice can be based on your interests and your show.  Which do you think will be most interesting? 

Option 1: What do characters say?   Given a selected character, create visual representations and interactions that help me understand what they tend to say.  For this option, use an encoding designed for text data (such as a word cloud or another representation we discuss in class).  You can add in additional views, like bar charts and line charts, but I want to see at least one other encoding that is designed for text data. 
I want to see what words do they use most often, and how frequently they use them.  Note- you'll need to remove 'stem' words, (the, and, if, was....), to get at the more interesting things they say.  Or you can focus on words that are unique to them- like that they say more frequently than other characters.  Tutorial to follow on this. 
I want to see if they have any sentences or phrases they say frequently?  For instance, if the show is Star Trek The Next Generation, Captain Picard likely says 'Captain's Log. Stardate' often.  Or if it is Futurama, Prof. Farnsworth says 'Good news, everyone!' 
Does what they say tend to change from season to season?  Allow me to select either the whole show or a season and see what this character says for the selection. 
Option 2: Who speaks to each other or appears in scenes together. For this option, use an encoding designed for network data (such as an arc diagram or a chord diagram).  You can add in additional views, like bar charts and line charts, but I want to see at least one other encoding that is designed for network data. 
I want to understand which characters speak most often to or with each other- such as in the same scene, or in interlaced dialogue with each other.  Some scripts have scene cuts, and you can use that information to link the characters together.  Or you can look at how often a character's line is close to another character's line- as an approximation.  
Note- this could be a considered a network or a graph, with weighted edges.  The upcoming lecture on graphs and networks, and tutorials on layouts, will help with this.  
I want to be able to update this view by episode and season, to see how this changes over time. 
Include design sketches to illustrate your design decisions, and discuss why you chose option 1 vs option 2. 

A-goals:   all of the C-goals and the B-goals plus: 

If you chose option 1 for the B goals, do option 2.  If you chose option 2 for the B goals, do option 1.   As before, include sketches to illustrate your design decisions.   
For your show, choose at least one additional direction, based on what you know about the show.  This will likely need to be supported in an additional view of the data and through additional data pre-processing work and interactions.  Some ideas, but feel free to propose your own:
Select two characters, and see what words they most often use when talking to each other- Do Jim and Pam say different things to each other (in the same scene) vs Pam and Michael in the Office? 
Search for a word or a phrase see when it is first used and how frequently, and then see when it goes away over the course of the show.  For instance, when does the Smoke Monster discussed on Lost? 
Add in a way to see who said this word or phrase most often? 
Do you want to add information about where people are speaking- for instance if there is a scene description with a named location, you can show who speaks most often in that place.  For instance, if the show is West Wing maybe you want to show who speaks most often in the Oval Office vs the Situation Room.  Do they say different things in those rooms? 
Show where these characters go over the course of the show, on a map.  This would be an interesting one for Game of Thrones or another show where characters travel around a lot. 
Do you want to explore who speaks when in an episode- for example, be able to select a couple of characters and see when in all the episodes they tend to speak, or when in the season they tend to appear.  For instance, is Liz Lemon most often the first and last person to speak in episodes on 30 Rock?    
Think about your show, and come up with some ideas of your own !  
As before- include a description of your design decisions, with sketches.
Documentation:
For documentation: assume that someone is encountering your project for the first time. This documentation must be publicly available on each team members personal webpage.  The content for each team member can be identical, but it is important for each student to have a record of the project.  Screenshots are an important tool for communicating your work to others.  Including screenshots will improve your documentation grade. 

Explain the motivation for your application.  What can it allow someone to understand? 
1 section on the data: Describe the data and include a link. 
*** Since you will have done more work for this project to obtain and process the data, describe your methods and include processing scripts. 
1 section on the visualization components: Explain each view of the data, the GUI, etc.  Explain how you can interact with your application, and how the views update in response to these interactions. 
Include design sketches and design justifications 
1 section on what your application enables you to discover: Present some findings you arrive at with your application.  Include screen shots to illustrate.
1 section on your process- what libraries did you use?  How did you structure your code?  How can you access it and run it?  Link to your code (and the live application, if it is deployed online). 
Include a 2-3 minute demo video, showing your application in action.  The easiest way to record this is with a screen capture tool, which also captures audio- such as Quicktime.  Use a voiceover or video captions to explain your application.  Demo videos should be sufficient on their own, but can reference your documentation.  Include the name of the project, your name, the project components, and how your application works.  You can present it on your webpage or on youtube, but linked on your webpage. 
Document who on your team did which component of the project.  Ex.  If someone worked on the data, and on bar charts, list their effort on these components.
