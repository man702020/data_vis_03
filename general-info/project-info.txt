Overview: 
Let's do something fun for our last project.  We are going to look at TV!  Specifically, transcripts from TV shows.  I want to find ways to show who appears in the show- the characters. How often do they speak?  How much do they say?  What do they tend to talk about?  How often do they share a scene with other characters?  Are there changes between seasons, during a season in these patterns?  

Like project 2, this is a group project.  You get to choose your groups.  They can be the same as the previous group, or you can change things up. 

You get to pick a scripted TV show (so no reality TV or interviews/news shows), and create an interactive visualization, using d3 and javascript/html, to help someone understand the characters, how the characters interact, what they characters tend to say, and how these patterns change over the run of the show.   

Step 1: Pick a scripted TV show: 

Here are some stipulations : 

1. The show must have transcripts for at least 50 episodes

>50 episode TV shows include: Parks n Rec, the Office, Lost, Star Trek TNG, The Good Place, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Game of Thrones, Dr. Who, Friends....
So this excludes <50 episode TV shows such as shorter format TV shows (Queens Gambit)  or short lived TV shows (Firefly), as fantastic as they are, they don't fit this assignment
2. Characters 

There must be >10 recurring characters, so characters that appear in more than one episode and across seasons.  
3. It must have transcripts that:

You can download or scrape from public webpages, and I'll post a tutorial about how to get these scripts using web scraping
The transcripts have to include who is speaking.  Many of them don't- they just list what is said, which isn't enough for our project.  We have to have an indication of who said what. 
You have to be able to order the transcripts (eg. season 3, episode 2, or episode 101)
For the A goals, you need a way to determine which characters are speaking to each other or appearing in the same scene.  If your transcripts include scene break indicators of some kind, you can use this info to infer who appears in a scene together.  Or, you will have to use some other method- like how often characters speak back to back, or how often characters use each other's names in their text- referencing someone.  
4. Content:  Remember, you are going to present this to your peers and it will be public on your professional webpage.  So, be mindful about the TV show you choose.  For instance, although Orange is the New Black is a critically acclaimed TV show, the characters swear a lot and use other offensive language that will show up in visual summaries of what words different characters use.  So, just be mindful of this when you are choosing a show. 

5. Can't use shows chosen by students last year (list at the bottom).  I need to make sure projects are original.  

How to find the transcripts:

Not all shows have transcripts.  Not all shows have transcripts that fit the above criteria. 

Some you will find on webpages written in html, and you will want to decide whether you can scrape these pages, isolate the content you need using regular expressions, and do the rest of the project.  

Others are on Kaggle and already parsed and formatted in CSV.  But- you need to decide whether it has the information you need to do the project.  

I'll post some suggestions at the bottom. 

Step 2: Data pre-processing

Scrape and pre-process the scripts.  Tutorials to follow.  

Tutorial 12: How to scrape a webpage and turn it into data

Step 3: Interactive visualization

As before, I have a set of goals which you can work towards to build your application.
