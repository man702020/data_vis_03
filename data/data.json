Fire.  Air.  Water.  When I was a boy, my father, Avatar Aang, told me the story of how he and his friends heroically ended the Hundred Year War.  Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko  transformed the Fire Nation colonies into the United Republic of Nations,  a society where benders and nonbenders from all over the world could live and thrive together in peace and harmony.  They named the capital of this great land, Republic City.  Avatar Aang accomplished many remarkable things in his life.  But sadly, his time in this world came to an end. And like the cycle of the seasons, the cycle of the Avatar began anew."}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "The White Lotus has honored my family by coming.  Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Senna", "text": "Welcome."}, {"speaker": "White Lotus leader", "text": "We have investigated many claims, both here and in the Northern Tribe. All have turned out to be false."}, {"speaker": "Senna", "text": "Then you should be happy to know, your search has come to an end."}, {"speaker": "White Lotus leader", "text": "What makes you so sure your daughter is the one ?"}, {"speaker": "Senna", "text": "Korra! Please come in here!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm the Avatar! You gotta deal with it!"}, {"speaker": "Katara", "text": "She's strong."}, {"speaker": "White Lotus leader", "text": "She lacks restraint."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Woohoo!  Hey, why all the doom and gloom, people?  We should be celebrating!  Three elements down,  one to go!"}, {"speaker": "Yim", "text": "You're getting ahead of yourself as usual , Korra. We haven't decided if you passed your firebending test yet."}, {"speaker": "White Lotus leader", "text": "Ever since you were a little girl, you've excelled at the physical side of bending, but completely ignored the spiritual side.  The Avatar must master both."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I haven't ignored it, it just doesn't come as easy to me.  But that's why I should start training with Tenzin immediately.  He's Mister Spiritual."}, {"speaker": "White Lotus leader", "text": "Do you believe she's ready, Master Katara?"}, {"speaker": "Katara", "text": "Yes. If anyone can teach her what she needs to learn, it's Tenzin."}, {"speaker": "White Lotus leader", "text": "Very well, Korra. It's time for you to begin your airbending training."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Yes! Finally!  I mean,  thank you all for believing in me."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Naga, you should have seen it!  I kicked some firebender butt, and I passed!  Tenzin will be here in a few days."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Just taking Naga out for a stroll.  Don't worry, we're not going far."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Naga, go!  That a girl. Go! Go! Go!"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?  It looks like we're there.  I know it, this is very familiar! Are we here yet? Are we here yet? Ooh, please tell me we're here!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Yes, Ikki,  as I've been telling you for the last fifteen minutes, we are,  finally , here."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Hello, Mother.  I can't tell you how happy I am to see you.  Please, help me."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Unhand me, strange woman!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "That's your grandmother, Meelo."}, {"speaker": "Katara", "text": "It's so good to see all of you."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Gran Gran, I've been reading all about your old adventures. I've been dying to ask you: What happened to Zuko's mom?"}, {"speaker": "Katara", "text": "Well, Jinora, it's an incredible tale--"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Gran Gran, you look old. How old are you? And why is it so cold in the South Pole?  Can we make a campfire, and all huddle around it, and tell scary stories, and make snowmen?  And then can you make the snowmen move with waterbending and chase us? Wouldn't that be  fuuun? Huh?  Wouldn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Pema, let me help you. Careful now, careful."}, {"speaker": "Pema", "text": "Stop doting on me. I'm not helpless, I'm just pregnant."}, {"speaker": "Katara", "text": "The baby's strong .  I see another airbender in your future."}, {"speaker": "Pema", "text": "All I want is one child like me ,  a nice non -bender, who doesn't  blast wind in my face every five seconds."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Mommy, look,  I'm a snowbender !"}, {"speaker": "Pema", "text": "Were Tenzin and his siblings this crazy when they were kids?"}, {"speaker": "Katara", "text": "Kya and Bumi certainly were, but  Tenzin has always been ...  rather serious."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Mother, please ."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Korra?  Look at you, so big and strong.  You've grown into quite the young Avatar."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Master Tenzin, I'm so glad you're here. I can't wait to get started."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Yes, well ..."}, {"speaker": "Pema", "text": "You're going to have to tell her sooner or later."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Tell me what?"}, {"speaker": "Katara", "text": "You're not staying, are you?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I'm afraid not. We're only visiting for the night. Then I have to return to Republic City."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "But ... no, you're supposed to move here.  You're supposed to teach me."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I'm sorry, Korra. Your airbending training is going to have to wait."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "So, how long until you're ready to teach me airbending?  A week? A month?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "It could be much longer."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I don't understand. Why are you making me wait?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I have a responsibility to Republic City. I am one of its leaders, and the situation there is very unstable right now."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "But you also have a responsibility to teach me.  Believe me, I'd be happy to find another airbending master, but you're the only one.  We're stuck with each other."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I wish there were another way."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Wait, there is! If you can't stay here, then I'll go back to Republic City with you! It's perfect!"}, {"speaker": "White Lotus leader", "text": "Absolutely not!  The city is far too dangerous. Avatar Aang tasked us with keeping you safe while you mastered the four elements."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I get that, but I don't think keeping me locked up in this compound like a prisoner is what he had in mind."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I know this is difficult to accept, but it's not the right time for you to come to the city."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Whatever."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Goodbye, Gran Gran!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Oogi, yip-yip!"}, {"speaker": "Katara", "text": "Nice night for an escape, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I have to leave. I have to find my own path as the Avatar."}, {"speaker": "Katara", "text": "I know you do."}, {"speaker": "Katara", "text": "Aang's time has passed.  My brother and many of my friends are gone.  It's time for you and your generation to take over the responsibility of keeping peace and balance in the world.

I'll miss you."}, {"speaker": "Senna", "text": "We love you so much."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Naga, we're here!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Thanks for the ride!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Wow, look at this place.  I've never seen so many Satomobiles!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Air Temple Island. That's where Tenzin lives.  You ready for a little swim, girl?  Okay, okay! Food first, then air temple!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Watch out, Naga! Look out!"}, {"speaker": "Pedestrian", "text": "Watch where you're going!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Whoops, sorry about that. Excuse us. Coming through. Heads up. Eh, sorry, we're new in town."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Naga, wait.  We'll take one of everything, please."}, {"speaker": "Shopkeeper", "text": "That will be twenty yuans."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Uh ... I don't have any money?"}, {"speaker": "Shopkeeper", "text": "Then what good are you to me?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Don't worry, girl.  The city's huge. I bet we could find a place to rustle up something to eat."}, {"speaker": "Gommu", "text": "Uh, say, think I can I get one of them tasty-smelling  fishies?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Oh, uh, yeah, sure."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "So, do you ... live in  that bush?"}, {"speaker": "Gommu", "text": "Yes, presently that is what I do call home. Took me a while to procure a bush that beauteous.  This park is quite popular with all the vagabonds."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "So there are a lot of you out here? I thought everyone in this city was \"living it up\"."}, {"speaker": "Gommu", "text": "Hey, you've got a lot to learn, newcomer.  Welcome to Republic City."}, {"speaker": "Guard", "text": "Hey, you!  Stop! You can't fish here!"}, {"speaker": "Gommu", "text": "You best skedaddle!"}, {"speaker": "Protester", "text": "Are you tired of living under the tyranny of benders? Then join the Equalists!  For too long, the bending elite of this city  have forced nonbenders to live as lower class citizens. Join Amon, and together we will tear down the bending establishment."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What are you talking about?  Bending is the coolest thing in the world."}, {"speaker": "Protester", "text": "Oh yeah? Let me guess: you're a bender."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Yeah, I am."}, {"speaker": "Protester", "text": "Then I bet you'd just love to knock me off this platform with some waterbending, huh?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm seriously thinking about it."}, {"speaker": "Protester", "text": "This is what's wrong with this city! Benders like this girl only use their power to oppress us!"}, {"speaker": "Crowd", "text": "Yeah! Get out of here!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What? I'm not oppressing anyone!  You're ... you're oppressing yourselves!"}, {"speaker": "Protester", "text": "That didn't even make sense."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Excuse me, I think I'm lost.  How do I get to Air Temple Island from here?"}, {"speaker": "Old woman", "text": "Just head down this street."}, {"speaker": "Old woman", "text": "You should get moving, young lady.  It isn't safe."}, {"speaker": "Viper", "text": "Mr. Chung, please tell me that you have my money,  or else I can't guarantee I can protect your fine establishment."}, {"speaker": "Chung", "text": "I'm sorry, business has been slow. Please,  take one of my phonographs."}, {"speaker": "Viper", "text": "My friend here is not a music lover.  Give me the money, or else -"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Or else what, hoodlum?"}, {"speaker": "Viper", "text": "Since you're obviously fresh off the boat, let me explain a couple things.  You're in Triple Threat Triad territory, and we're about to put you , in the hospital."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You're the only ones who are gonna need a hospital  and, for your sake, I hope there's one nearby."}, {"speaker": "Viper", "text": "Who do you think you are?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Why don't you come and find out?"}, {"speaker": "Old woman", "text": "What just happened?"}, {"speaker": "Young man", "text": "Did she just earthbend?"}, {"speaker": "Old woman", "text": "Can she firebend, too?"}, {"speaker": "Young man", "text": "Could she be?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Got an idea about who I am now , chumps?"}, {"speaker": "Mushi", "text": "Come on!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You're not getting away!"}, {"speaker": "Metalbending cops", "text": "Police! Freeze where you are!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Cool! Metalbenders!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I caught the bad guys for you, officers."}, {"speaker": "Saikhan", "text": "Arrest them!"}, {"speaker": "Saikhan", "text": "You're under arrest, too."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What do you mean I'm under arrest?  Those are the bad guys over there! They were smashing up a shop!"}, {"speaker": "Saikhan", "text": "From the looks of it, you smashed up a lot more than that."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Wait, you - you can't arrest me!  Let me explain!"}, {"speaker": "Saikhan", "text": "You can explain yourself all you like, down at headquarters."}, {"speaker": "Driver", "text": "Hey!"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Let's see.  Multiple counts of destruction of private and city property,  not to mention evading arrest ...  You're in a whole mess of trouble, young lady."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "But there were some thugs threatening a helpless shopkeeper, and I had it ..."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Can it!  You should have called the police and stayed out of the way."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "But I couldn't just sit by and do nothing. It's my duty to help people.  See, I'm the Avatar."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Oh, I am well aware of who you are.  And your Avatar title might impress some people,  but not me."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "All right, fine.  Then I want to talk to whoever's in charge."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "You're talking to her. I'm Chief Beifong."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Wait, Beifong? Lin Beifong?  You're Toph's daughter!"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "What of it?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Well then, why are you treating me like a criminal? Avatar Aang and your mother were friends. They saved the world together."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "That's ancient history.  And it's got diddly-squat to do with the mess you're in right now.  You can't just waltz in here and dole out vigilante justice like you own the place!"}, {"speaker": "Metalbending cop", "text": "Chief,  Councilman Tenzin is here."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Let him in."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Tenzin, sorry ...  I got a little sidetracked on my way to see you."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Lin, you are looking radiant as usual."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Cut the garbage, Tenzin. Why is the Avatar in Republic City? I thought you were supposed to be moving down to the South Pole to train her."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "My relocation has been delayed.  The Avatar, on the other hand, will be heading back to the South Pole immediately, where she will stay put."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "But\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "If you would be so kind as to  drop the charges against Korra, I will take full responsibility for today's regrettable events and cover all the damages."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Fine.  Get her out of my city."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Always a pleasure, Lin.  Let's go, Korra."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Tenzin, please,  don't send me back home."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "You blatantly disobeyed my wishes and the orders of the White Lotus."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Katara agreed with me that I should come.  She said my destiny is in Republic City."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Don't bring my mother into this!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Look, I can't wait any longer to finish my training.  Being cooped up and hidden away from the world isn't helping me become a better Avatar.  I saw a lot of the city today, and it's totally out of whack. I understand now why you need to stay. Republic City does need you. But it needs me, too."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "You ... ah ..."}, {"speaker": "Ruffled police officer", "text": "Is this your polar bear dog, miss?"}, {"speaker": "Meelo and Ikki", "text": "Korra!"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Are you coming to live with us on the island?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No, I'm sorry, Ikki. I have to go home now."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Wait.  I have done my best to guide Republic City toward the dream my father had for it, but you're right. It has fallen out of balance since he passed. I thought I should put off your training in order to uphold his legacy,  but you are his legacy.  You may stay and train airbending here with me.  Republic City needs its Avatar once again."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Yes! Thank you! You're the best!"}, {"speaker": "Meelo, Ikki, and Jinora", "text": "Yaaaaay!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Hello?  I'm Korra,  your new Avatar."}, {"speaker": "Male journalist #1", "text": "Does this mean you've moved to Republic City?"}, {"speaker": "Female journalist", "text": "Were you trying to send a message to the Triads yesterday?"}, {"speaker": "Male journalist #2", "text": "Will you be fighting crime or the Anti-bending Revolution, or both?"}, {"speaker": "Male journalist #3", "text": "Will you be working with Chief Beifong and the police?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Uh ... yes, I am definitely here to stay, but honestly I - I don't exactly have a plan yet.  See, I'm still in training, but, look, all I know is  Avatar Aang meant for this city to be the center of peace and balance in the world, and I believe we can make his dream a reality.  I look forward to serving you!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm so happy to be here. Thank you, Republic City!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "All right, that's all the questions the Av\u2013"}, {"speaker": "Lieutenant", "text": "Amon, how do you want to handle this?"}, {"speaker": "Amon", "text": "So, the Avatar has arrived early.

Fire. Air. Water. Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world."}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "Republic City welcomes a new citizen into our arms. Avatar Korra! After years of seclusion in the South, this master of water, earth, and fire seeks to add airbending to her list of skills. And under the tutelage of Tenzin, Avatar Aang's son, she should go far. But will this cool, calm, collective master of air be able to tame this hotheaded teen?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "And, in the final round, the Buzzard Wasps  w on with a decisive knockout!  What do you say we go to the arena tonight,  catch a few pro-bending matches?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "That sport is a mockery of the noble tradition of bending."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Come on, Tenzin! I've dreamed about seeing a pro-bending match since I was a kid  and now I'm just a ferry ride away from  the arena."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Korra, you're not here to watch that drivel. You're here to finish your Avatar training.  So, for the time being, I want you to remain on the island."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Is that why you're keeping the White Lotus sentries around,  to watch my every move?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Yes. In order to learn airbending I believe you require a calm,  quiet environment, free from any distractions."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "All right,  you're the master."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "So, my mother informed me that  you've never been able to airbend before."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Yeah, but I don't know why. The other elements came so easily to me,  but every single time I've tried airbending-  nothing."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "That's perfectly all right. You just need to be patient.  Often the element that's the most difficult for the Avatar to master is the one most opposite to the Avatar's personality.  For Aang, it was earthbending."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Yeah. Well, I'm about as opposite an airbender as you can get."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Let's begin your first lesson."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Korra's gonna airbend! Korra's gonna airbend!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What is that contraption?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "A time-honored tool that teaches the most fundamental aspect of airbending. Jinora, would you like to explain this exercise?"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "The goal is to weave your way through the gates and make it to the other side without touching them."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Seems easy enough."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Jinora forgot to say that you have to make it through while the gates are spinning."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "The key is to be like the leaf.  Flow with the movement of the gates.  Jinora will demonstrate."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Airbending is all about spiral movements.

You didn't say anything about listening to one."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "You-  ... you know what I meant!  Anyway shouldn't y-? Shouldn't you be in bed by now?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I think I'm doing it wrong."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "There's nothing to do. Let your mind and your spirit be free,  for air is the element of freedom.  Is something ... funny?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Yeah, you're telling me to embrace freedom, but you won't even let me listen to the radio. And forget about leaving this island!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Please, Korra.  Look at Meelo; he's able to meditate peacefully."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Actually, I think he's asleep."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "What? Well, at least he has the relaxing part down."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Whatever. None of this airbending stuff makes any sense to me."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I know you're frustrated, but these teachings will sink in over time.

Come here, I want you to meet my brother, Mako."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Mako? Wow, I-I heard you playing on the radio."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Come on, Bolin, we're up."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "... or I could meet him later."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Yeah, sorry about that.

The two teams waste no time trying to blast each other out of zone one!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "Hasook is the first to feel the heat of the Tigerdillos! He tries to return the favor, but they're too fast for him, while Mako shows off his trademark \"cool under fire\" style!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "Oooh, the Tigerdillos score with a walloping one-two combo!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "Can their teammate hold on to their zone one territory?

Get your act together!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "The Fire Ferrets are knocked into zone two and the Tigerdillos advance!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "The Fire Ferrets cinch the round in the closing seconds! It's one apiece,  still anyone's match as we go into the third and final round!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "Hasook stumbles, and now he tumbles right into his teammate!  He and Bolin better untangle quick if they don't want to ...  oh, too late!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Oh, no!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "It's all up to Mako now!  He's bobbing and weaving! He's weaving and bobbing!  But he's not hitting back!  If Mako's knocked out, the Ferrets' fabulous season is over!  He is dancing on the edge of the ring, surviving the three on one barrage! It seems his plan is to let the Tigerdillos punch themselves out!  And his plan is working! Han is in the pool!  They've got nothing left in the tank and Mako is on the offensive!  It's two on one!  Scratch that, it's one on one, and it's an earth and fire slllugfest! There's so much smoke and dust from the firefight, I can't even see where the Fire Ferret is!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "It's a knockout! What a wing-dinger of a hat trick, folks!  Mako pulls off the upset of the season, winning the match for the Fire Ferrets!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Woohoo! Yes!  One more win and we're in the championship tournament!  So, what'd ya think, Korra? Bolin's got some moves, huh?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What did I think? What did I think ? That was am\u200bazing!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "You did more harm than good out there. You almost cost us the match!"}, {"speaker": "Hasook", "text": "We won, didn't we?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Barely!"}, {"speaker": "Hasook", "text": "Get off my case, pal!  Ugh!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Useless."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You guys were incredible out there!  Especially you, Mr. Hat Trick!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Oh, you're still here?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Oh, you're still a jerk?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Ooh!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Anyway,  I've been immersed in bending my entire life, but I never learned how to move like that! It's like there's a whole new style here!  Think you could show me a few tricks?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Ab-so-lutely!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Right now? Come on, Bolin."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Just ignore him.  Yeah, I could show you the basics.  I'm just not sure how my earthbending would translate to your waterbending,  but we'll figure it out."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Won't be a problem.  I'm actually an earthbender."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I'm sorry, no, no! I didn't mean to assume. 'Cause I, you know, I was just figuring ... with your Water Tribe getup ... that you are ... a Water Tribe ... gal."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Nope, you're right. I'm a waterbender. And a firebender."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Mm. Mm-hmm. I'm very confused right now."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "You're the Avatar,  and I'm an idiot."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Both are true."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "No ... way .  Th\u200be Avatar!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "All right! Let's see what'cha got!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "That was great! Good power! But in a real match, you'd be a sitting turtle duck.  Not so upright and flatfooted!  Stay light on your toes, right up until the moment when you need to dig in and strike. Then ...  pop, pop!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Okay, let me try it again."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Wow! Nice adjustment!  You're a natural at this."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Not bad."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What's it take to impress this guy?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "What? I said \"not bad\".  You know what, it's getting late.  I think I'm gonna turn in. You kids have fun.  Nice to meet you, Avatar Korra."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Yeah, been a real pleasure."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "See ya upstairs, bro."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Upstairs?  You guys live here ?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Yup. In the attic. It's nothin' fancy, but we have some great views!  So, back to bending. Why don't you throw that combo one more time?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Patience, Korra!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "That was a two-thousand-year-old historical treasure!  What ...  What is wrong with you?!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "There's nothing wrong with m\u200be ! I've been practicing just like you taught me, but it isn't sinking in, okay?  It hasn't clicked like you said it would!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Korra, this isn't something you can force. If you would only listen to me ..."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I have been! But you know what I think? Maybe the problem isn't me! Maybe the reason I haven't learned airbending yet is because  you're a terrible teacher!"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Yeah! You're a terrible teacher, Daddy!"}, {"speaker": "Pema", "text": "Okay! Everyone here?  Wait. Where's Korra?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Honestly, Pema, I am at my wit's end with that girl! I ... I don't know how to get through to her!"}, {"speaker": "Pema", "text": "Dear, the best thing you can do right now is to give Korra some space."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "You must promise me that your teenage years won't be like this!"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "I will make no such promises."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I didn't miss your match, did I? You guys look like you lost already."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "We might as well have."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Hasook's a no-good no-show!"}, {"speaker": "Referee", "text": "You got two minutes to come out ready to play, or you're disqualified."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Well, there goes our shot at the tournament ... and the winnings."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Can't you ask one of those guys to fill in?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Nah. The rules say you can only compete on one team."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Well, then ...  how about me? I'm a top-notch waterbender,  if I do say so myself."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "But, you're the Avatar.  Isn't that cheating?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "It isn't cheating if I only do waterbending."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "No way. I'd rather forfeit than look like a fool out there."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence."}, {"speaker": "Referee", "text": "Time's up. You in or out?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "We're in!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "We are?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Yes!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Hey, I didn't agree to this!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You can thank me later."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "This girl is crazy."}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "Looks like the Fire Ferrets have ferreted out a last minute replacement waterbender.  Let's see if she's another diamond in the rough like the brothers from the school of hard knocks!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Don't do anything too fancy or aggressive.  In fact, don't do anything. Just try not to get knocked off the ring."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You got it, captain ."}, {"speaker": "Referee", "text": "Players! Are you ready?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Woohoo! Man overboard!"}, {"speaker": "Referee", "text": "Fire Ferret waterbender, penalty! Move back one zone!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What? Why?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "You're only allowed to knock players off the back of the ring! Not over the sides!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Oh. Whoops."}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "And we're back in action after that hiccup, but I'm not so sure this replacement player knows what she's doing."}, {"speaker": "Referee", "text": "Foul! Over the line! Move back to zone three!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Urgh!  I'll show you over the line!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "The Platypus Bears take round one!  The Platypus Bears know a green player when they see one, and they are focusing the brunt of their bending on this poor girl!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "Wait a minute! Did that waterbender just earthbend ?"}, {"speaker": "Referee", "text": "Foul! I ... think."}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "Did I see that right?  Hold on, folks, we're just waiting for the referee's official call, but ...  I-I think this replacement player could be ... no, there's no way!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Pardon me, everyone, have you seen Korra this evening? She's not in her room."}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "You've gotta be kidding me!  She's the Avatar , folks!  Playing in a pro-bending match!  Can you believe that?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I'll get her myself!"}, {"speaker": "Referee", "text": "The Avatar will be permitted to continue so long as she solely bends water!"}, {"speaker": "Platypus Bears", "text": "Awww!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "This girl may be the Avatar, but she's no pro-bender and the Platypus Bears are intent on exploiting that weakness!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "They're giving her their best, and her best ain't good enough to stop it!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "Aaaaand she's in the drink."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Oh, hey, Tenzin. I thought you didn't like coming to these matches."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Once again, you have flagrantly disobeyed my orders. You were to stay on the island! Let's go."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No! I'm kind of in the middle of something."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I have tried my very best to get through to you by being gentle and patient,  but clearly the only thing you respond to is force! So I am ordering you to come back to the temple right now !"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Why? So I can sit around and meditate about how bad I am at airbending?  You know, I'm beginning to think there's a reason I haven't been able to learn it! Because, maybe, I don't even need it!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "What? That is a ludicrous suggestion!  The Avatar needs to learn airbending! It is not optional!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No! This is what I need to learn! Modern styles of fighting!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Being the Avatar isn't all about fighting, Korra!  When will you learn that?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I have a match to go finish."}, {"speaker": "Ring announcer", "text": "The Platypus Bears win round two!  Round three!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "The Platypus Bears come out of the gate and quickly go after the Ferret brothers! They're corralled in the corner, wedged in the edge of zone one, unable to come to the Avatar's rescue! And boy, does she need it!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "Looks like the Avatar's pro-bending debut is going to be cut short! She's been pushed back to zone three, and the water is calling her name!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "It's only a matter of time before ..."}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "Hold the phone! Stop the presses! She's still in the game, folks! And she's moving like an entirely different player! All of a sudden, the Platypus Bears' strikes are only striking air!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "How about that?"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "The Platypus Bears have no juice left, but Mako and Bolin are still fresh and juicy!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "Knockout!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Woohoo!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "The Fire Ferrets come from waaay behind and steal the win!  What an upset, folks! The rookies, Avatar in tow,  have nabbed a place in the championship tournament! I can not believe it!"}, {"speaker": "Korra and Bolin", "text": "Hahaha, yeah! Yes!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Korra ... what can I say? You really came alive in that last round. The way you dodged their attacks ... you are a natural."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Thanks, but I can't take all the credit.  Someone else taught me those moves."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm really sorry ... about everything I said.  I was really frustrated with myself,  and I took it out on you."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I think I owe you an apology too.

One day, my father confronted this man, but when he did,  that firebender took my family from me. Then, he took my face.  I've been forced to hide behind a mask ever since.  As you know, the Avatar has recently arrived in Republic City.  And if she were here,  she would tell you that bending brings balance to the world. But, she is wrong. The only thing bending has brought to the world, is suffering.  It has been the cause of every war in every era.  But that is about to change.  I know you have been wondering, \"What is the Revelation?\"  You are about to get your answer.  Since the beginning of time,  the spirits have acted as guardians of our world, and they have spoken to me.  They say the Avatar has failed humanity.  That is why the spirits have chosen me to usher in a new era of balance. They have granted me a power  that will make Equality a reality. The power to take a person's bending away.

There they go, here we are, all alone in the gym, just you and me, two alone people. Together. Alone."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Ah, I gotta head back to the air temple to train with Tenzin. See ya!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Work with me here, Pabu! You wanna look spic and span in your new uniform, don't you?  So, what do you think of Korra, in a \"girlfriend\" sort of way?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "She's great! But I think it makes more sense for me to go for Asami."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I was talking about a girlfriend for me! Leave some ladies for the rest of us!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I know, that's what I thought you meant."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Well ...?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I don't know, Bo.

She's more like a pal."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Bro, you're nuts! Korra and I are perfect for each other: she's strong, I'm strong; she's fun, I'm fun; she's beautiful, I'm gorgeous ! Okay, I don't care what you think, I'm gonna ask Korra out."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Look, it just isn't smart to date a teammate, especially during the tournament.

Listen to you two, I-I'm not interested in Mako or any romantic stuff.  Besides he's all into that prissy, beautiful, elegant, rich girl ... but let's just pretend for a second I am interested in him. What would I do?"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Ooh! I just read a historical saga where the heroine fell in love with the enemy general's son, who's supposed to marry the princess. You should do what she did!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Tell me!"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "She rode a dragon into battle and burned down the entire country .  Then she jumped into a volcano. It was so romantic!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Uhh ..."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "No, no, no!  The best way to win a boy's heart is to brew a love potion of rainbows and sunsets that makes true lovers sprout wings and fly into a magical castle in the sky, where they get married and eat clouds with spoons and use stars as ice cubes in their moonlight punch. Forever and ever and ever!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "The volcano is starting to make more sense to me now."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Oh, hey Pema.

Years ago I was in the exact the same situation, with Tenzin."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Daddy was in love with someone else before you?"}, {"speaker": "Pema", "text": "That's right."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "So what did you do?"}, {"speaker": "Pema", "text": "Well, for the longest time, I did nothing. I was so shy and scared of rejection, but watching my soul mate spend his life with the wrong woman became too painful. So I hung my chin out there and I confessed my love to Tenzin. And the rest is history."}, {"speaker": "Korra, Ikki, and Jinora", "text": "Wooow!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "Folks, after a year of waiting the Pro-bending Championship is finally here.

And their opponents, the Red Sands Rabaroos!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "What an explosive opening volley. Both teams quickly recover and unleash a barrage of bending. I am astonished with the level of improvement displayed here by the Fire Ferrets. No wonder the Avatar has been absent from the papers lately. She's obviously had her nose to the grindstone in the gym. The Ferrets advance into Rabaroo territory and are holding nothing back. Nice sprawl there by Mako. Bolin strikes, Ula dodges, and all three Rabaroos are down. The Fire Ferrets easily take round one!"}, {"speaker": "Ring announcer", "text": "Round two!"}, {"speaker": "Shiro Shinobi", "text": "The Rabaroos are looking for payback and they go straight after Bolin. Korra comes to his defense and water-whacks Umi back into zone two!

These Ferrets are working together like a well-oiled bending machine. Bolin passes Adi back into zone two and the Ferrets get the green light to advance. The Rabaroos are just fighting to stay at their feet at this point. Out goes Adi, and Ula, and Umi!"}, {"speaker": "Ring announcer", "text": "All three rounds go to the Future Industries Fire Ferrets to win the opening match of the tournament!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "That's what I'm talking about!

You know, I feel like the two of us have been connecting really well out of the ring, too."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Uh, sure."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "So, I was thinking we should spend some time together."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Oh, we've been spending lots of time together."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I mean outside of the gym, and not while searching for kidnapped family members or fighting chi-blockers."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I don't know. Asami and I have \u2014"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Look, I really like you and I think we are meant for each other!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Korra, I'm really sorry, but I just don't feel the same way about you."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Forget I ever said anything ..."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Congratulations, guys! You were so amazing out there."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "So, Korra, I was thinking, you and me, we could get some dinner together, sort of a date situation."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Oh, that's really sweet, but I don't think so. I don't feel very date -worthy."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Are you kidding me? You're the smartest, funniest, toughest, buffest, talentedest, incrediblest girl in the world!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You really feel that way about me?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I felt that way since the moment I saw you! Trust me, I know we're gonna have so much fun together."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You know what? I could use some fun. Okay, sure!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Yes! Who's the luckiest guy in the world? Right here, Bolin!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "So, how do you like it?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Hmm, it's delicious and totally authentic! I didn't realize how much I missed Water Tribe grub."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "That's great, 'cause this is my favorite joint. See? You love Water Tribe food, I love Water Tribe food, just another reason we are so great together."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "They are good noodles! Hey, who's that creepy guy over there who keeps glaring at us?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "That's Tahno and the Wolfbats, the reigning champs, three years running. Don't make eye contact."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Uh-oh, here he comes. Now don't mess with this guy, he's a nasty dude."}, {"speaker": "Tahno", "text": "Well, well, well, if it isn't the Fire Ferrets. Pro-bending's saddest excuse for a team. Tell me, how did a couple of amateurs like you luck your way into the tournament? Especially you, Uh-vatar. You know, if you'd like to learn how a real pro bends, I could give you some private lessons."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You wanna go toe-to-toe with me, pretty boy?"}, {"speaker": "Tahno", "text": "Go for it. I'll give you the first shot."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Korra, don't. He's just trying to bait you.

You are one of a kind, Korra."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "What kind of game are you playing?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Uh ... Pro-bending?

Ooh, that has got to sting!  And Bolin loses his noodles! Literally.  Which reminds me, this match is brought to you by our sponsor, Flamey-O Instant Noodles! Noodliest noodles in the United Republic.  The Buzzard Wasps fly deeper into Ferret territory. And Mako plunges into the pool! Can the Fire Ferrets hold on?

Let this be a warning to all of you benders out there:  if any of you stand in my way,  you will meet the same fate.  Now, to my followers: for years the Equalists have been forced to hide in the shadows, but now we have the numbers and the strength to create a new Republic City.  I'm happy to tell you that the  time for change has finally come. Very soon, the current tyrannical bending regime will be replaced by a fair-minded Equalist government.

I'm the Avatar."}, {"speaker": "Tarrlok", "text": "You're not, in fact, the Avatar.  You are merely a half-baked Avatar in training, which reminds me, how is your airbending going?

You just need to work through this airbending block."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Amazing advice. I'll get right on that."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I wasn't finished yet. You see, Aang not only had his bending teachers, but also his past lives to call upon for guidance.

I'm a spiritual failure, too."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "You may have made a connection without realizing it.  Perhaps something you mistook as a dream?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Maybe. I had a few weird hallucinations,  but I hardly even remember them."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "And did you see any previous Avatars in these visions?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I saw Aang. It seemed like he was in trouble. What do you think it means?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Hmm, I don't know.  But I urge you to meditate on these visions.

I just feel ... alone."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "No, that's nonsense! You're amazing!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Yeah and remember. Aang hadn't mastered all the elements when he was battling the Fire Nation. He was just a little kid."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "And he wasn't alone. He had his friends to help him.

But I am saddened to see what it has become: a cheap carnival that celebrates greedy and trivial humans.  I feel the time is fast approaching when the North can no longer stand idly by while our Southern brothers slip into total spiritual decay. Angry spirits are already attacking ships in your waters. I only hope we are not too late to change course."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Chief Unalaq everybody, always great to have him in town. Now, let's have some fun with Wacky Wushu's Dancing Otter penguins!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Wish me luck.  I'm making my move!  Whee!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Good luck."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Those two have always creeped me out.

So, you are from the north right?

You amuse me.  I will make you mine."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "You mean like a boyfriend, or like a slave ...?"}, {"speaker": "Eska", "text": "Yes.  Win me prizes."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Unalaq offered to train me. He says he can teach me about the spirits and my connection to them."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Sounds good. What does Tenzin think?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Tenzin thinks I'm his prisoner or one of his kids. I'll never finish training with him in charge."}, {"speaker": "Game guy", "text": "We have a winner!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I mean, you heard what Unalaq said.  The South is spiritually unbalanced and it's the Avatar's job to fix it, but my dad won't even let me think about Unalaq teaching me. Well?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Well what?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What do you think I should do?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I guess you should do what you think is right. I support whatever decision you make."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Oh thanks. That's a big help."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I thought you wanted me to be supportive? Now you want me to tell you what I think? Make up your mind!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Just forget it."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Uh, Naga what are you doing?  Naga, hush!  Quiet, Naga, you'll wake everyone up!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Uh, What's going on?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What, is, that?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Got it!  Don't got it!"}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "Korra!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Spirit, why are you angry with us? What have we done to offend you?"}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "Go in peace."}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "Korra!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Are you all right?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "How are you able to control that spirit when no one else could?"}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "As your father could tell you, I have spent my life studying the spirits and learning their ways. All of this knowledge is lost in the South, but I could teach you everything I know."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Chief Unalaq, clearly you are very knowledgeable, but Korra still has much to learn about airbending.

point. After Chief Unalaq's troops took over the South, Varrick incited an uprising. But Korra stopped the rebels from abducting her uncle.

Unalaq's rigged this trial, no doubt about it.

I'll talk to him.  I know I promised to respect whatever decision you made, but I must ask you to reconsider. Show these men and my brother mercy."}, {"speaker": "Hotah", "text": "Very well. I'll change their punishment. Your lives will be spared, but you will live them out in prison."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Thank you, Uncle."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "You like that, don't you, Blueberry Spicehead?

I promise."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "It's okay, Mom."}, {"speaker": "Senna", "text": "I-I hate feeling so helpless."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I know."}, {"speaker": "Hotah", "text": "What do you want?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "It's not about what I want. It's about what Naga wants.  And she'd like you to let my father out of prison."}, {"speaker": "Hotah", "text": "I-I'm sorry, but there is nothing I can do. I was just following Unalaq's orders."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What are you talking about?"}, {"speaker": "Hotah", "text": "I-I've said too much."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Unless you wanna be Naga's afternoon snack, you'd better keep talking."}, {"speaker": "Hotah", "text": "I-I've worked for your uncle for years!

Every word."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Then why did he have you free my mother and change your sentence?"}, {"speaker": "Hotah", "text": "He's trying to keep you on his side.

Just like when he got your father banished."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What do you mean, \"he got my father banished\"?"}, {"speaker": "Hotah", "text": "Nothing!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Keep talking."}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "Uh ... Hey there, Dad. You're looking well.  Look, uh, I'm sorry I didn't turn out to be an airbender like you hoped. But I've tried my best to keep the world safe. Hope I made you proud."}, {"speaker": "Kya", "text": "Of course he'd be proud of you, Bumi."}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "Kya! I-I was just,  uh ... cleaning off Dad's statue.  It's so dusty in here."}, {"speaker": "Kya", "text": "Come here."}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "Thanks, Kya. You always know when I need a hug."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Unalaq's a liar and a traitor!"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "I've been trying to tell you that from the get-go."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "What happened?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I found out the truth about my dad's banishment. Unalaq hired the barbarians to attack their tribe. Then he told them to hide in the spirit forest, knowing my dad would go after them."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Unalaq wanted your dad out of the way so he could become chief. It was a setup."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Just like the whole trial. I can't believe I trusted him. I'm busting my father and the rebels out of jail. I need your help."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "If you do this, there's no going back."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I know. Will you help me or not?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Of course, I'll help."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Me too."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Count me in!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I don't even want to know."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "So I'm guessing the breakup with Eska didn't go well?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "No, no, the honesty thing worked out great. So great she decided we should  get married!"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Sorry."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm pretty sure the guy is supposed to give the girl the betrothal necklace."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I guess Eska didn't get the memo."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Look, the only way to deal with crazy women is to lie big and leave fast. Lucky for you, Varrick's got your back. Now, gather 'round Ping-Ping. Let's talk plan."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "My dad's in there.  Where is he?"}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "I'm sorry, Korra. You'll never see your father again."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Where's my father?"}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "On a ship headed to the Northern Tribe. He'll serve out his sentence there."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Bring him back. Or I'm taking you out and the rest of your army."}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "Remember who you are. As the Avatar, you cannot threaten war. You must remain neutral, or our tribes will never find unity."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You don't want unity. You want power. You've always been jealous of my father, haven't you? You got him banished so you could become chief, and I bet it just killed you to learn he was the Avatar's father. No wonder you kept trying to take me away from him."}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "All I've ever wanted is to help you realize your destiny."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Well, I don't want your help anymore."}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "If you start a war, the dark spirits will annihilate the South. And even I will be powerless to stop them."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm done being manipulated by you. You're going to bring my father back, then you and your troops will return to the North."}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "And why would I do that?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Because you still need me to open the Northern portal."}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "No, I don't. You've served your purpose."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "If we get to Varrick's boat, we can still save your father."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Let's go."}, {"speaker": "Northern soldier", "text": "You have a license for that animal?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Uh, you fellas seen a traveling circus come through here?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Zhu Li, do the thing."}, {"speaker": "Excited man", "text": "That platypus bear is pooping money!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Where's your dad?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "On a ship headed north. Think we can catch up to it?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Sure, once you get us past our friends from the North."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "If only we had a plane to get me close to those ships. I could waterbend them out of the way."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "A plane? Well, why didn't you say so?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Um, why do you have a plane on your boat?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "In case the boat sinks, of course."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "But there's no runway. How are we supposed to take off?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Zhu Li! Take a note: \"Build runway\"."}, {"speaker": "Zhu Li", "text": "Yes, sir."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I have an idea."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Now!"}, {"speaker": "Helmsman", "text": "Captain, you'll never gonna believe this."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "There! My dad's on that ship!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Jump!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Where are the prisoners?"}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "Korra, this is crazy. You promised me you wouldn't do anything rash."}, {"speaker": "Korra,", "text": "I had to. I'll explain later."}, {"speaker": "Pema", "text": "Sweetie!  You're okay! Oh!  I was so worried!  Do you have something you wanna say to your sister?"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Ikki, I'm glad you're back."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Yeah, sorry we made fun of you."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Thanks. Wanna play airball?"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Sure!"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Yeah!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I wanted to apologize for how I acted yesterday. I've worked so hard to celebrate Dad's legacy that I may have overlooked the parts of him that were less than ideal."}, {"speaker": "Kya", "text": "And we're sorry for dumping our frustrations with Dad out on you."}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "Yeah, you didn't deserve that."}, {"speaker": "Kya", "text": "I thought you two might wanna see this.  Mom gave it to me before we left."}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "That is one good-looking family, huh?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "That's one happy family."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "So once I knew the truth, I couldn't sit by and do nothing."}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "My own brother betrayed me. And our entire tribe."}, {"speaker": "Rebel leader", "text": "What's our next move?"}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "I've been running from my past for too long. It's time to put my brother in his place."}, {"speaker": "Rebel leader", "text": "You have our support, Chief Tonraq."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Mine too. I'll be proud to fight alongside you, Dad."}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "No, Korra."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "But you said the South doesn't stand a change against Unalaq's forces. I can help."}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "The best way for you to help is by getting the president of the United Republic on our side. The South can give Unalaq a good fight for a while. But we'll need the United Forces in order to win this war."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "All right, I'll get you all the help you need. I love you, Dad."}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "I love you, too."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I really need to thank you, Korra."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "For what?

And not the fun kind!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "What is that?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "That would be my darling Eska.

If you can't make money during a war, you just flat-out cannot make money."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "It's dangerous on the seas right now, but I'm willing to try if you are."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "It'll be crazy risky, but I love crazy risky! End storm!  Zhu Li, get those other ideas to research and development. I want prototypes by next week."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I don't understand why it's so hard to get Republic City to support the South."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Don't worry, I'm already working on that.

It's not real."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "I had a film crew documenting the entire Northern invasion."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Ahhh! Sorry. I keep doing that."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "We're gonna cut this footage together with scenes we shoot of our superstar Bolin here playing a Southern Water Tribe hero  battling the evil Unalaq.

What do you think?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Oh, man, you should have seen Varrick today. That guy is a genius."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Uh-huh."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "He's gonna help Asami sell her mecha tanks to the South, and he came up with this great idea for Korra to get General Iroh to fight Unalaq without President Raiko ever even knowing."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "What? That's a terrible idea!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "And he's gonna put me in the movers as this hero, Nuktuk!  He's a man of action, but he's got a heart of gold. He was born in the tundra."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Look, I'm trying to do something that's actually important here."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Oh. Oh, sorry. Uh, sure. What is it?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Something doesn't make sense about this bombing. I just don't buy that the Northern Water Tribe was behind it.  Wait a second! That's him!

Nuktuk saves the day again!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "All right, Meelo, the first thing you need to do as a trainer is establish dominance . You are in charge. Never forget that. Now call Poki."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Poki, come here!  Poki.  Poki, no!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Meelo ... you're rewarding him for bad behavior."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "But he's tickling me."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "You can't let him nap in the bed with you.

Another open and shut case for the dynamic mustachioed duo!"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Wait, I think Mako might be onto something."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Chief, I know it's a long shot, but I have an idea how we can catch these guys."}, {"speaker": "Lu", "text": "Yeah, let's all listen to the rookie."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "He's doing a better job than you!"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Whooooo's hungry?"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Enough! I don't want to hear your lame-brained rookie ideas. You're a beat cop, not a detective. Now hit the street and do your job!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Lu and Gang are idiots. I hate them and their stupid mustaches."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Forget them. What's this idea of yours?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "A sting operation. I was thinking we'd set up a bait ship, take it out into the open ocean, and capture whoever attacks it."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Let's do it."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "It's not that easy. For the plan to work, we need the police, and Beifong already said no."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "We can make it work, just the two of us."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I don't know. I don't want to go behind Beifong's back. If she finds out, I could get kicked off the force."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Mako, I need your help. My Mom is gone. My Dad is in jail. Future Industries is all I have left of my family."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I want to help you, but this is more than a two-person job. First of all, we'd need a ship."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "You need a ship? I got a ship. I want in on whatever you're talking about. I love being in on plans."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "The less you know, the better."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Perfect! I love not knowing things."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "All right, I'm in. Let's get these guys."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "The ship's all loaded with the dummy crates. Let's get this sting operation going."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Not yet. We need some extra manpower."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "What about Korra?  No better muscle than the Avatar."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Right, uh ... Korra. Yeah, actually, she's um ... she's out of town right now."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Everything okay with you two?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Yeah, yeah. Forget about Korra. I'll go talk to Bolin."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Hey, Mako, what do you think? I did a little redecorating. It turns out that one of the perks of being a star, you get lots of cash."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Is this a marble statue of you?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "It's also  a hat rack."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "We don't even have hats."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "That's because we never had a hat rack. And now we do. Mako, you seem stressed. I think you need to take a little dipity dip."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I don't have time to take a dipity dip, okay? I'm trying to catch whoever's been attacking the shipments, and I need your help."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "You need my help?  I don't know. I'm kinda busy."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "You're sitting in a hot tub."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I'm maintaining my instrument. As an actor, my body is my instrument."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Are you gonna help or not?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "You know, I recall a time when I needed your help, and you basically told me to get a life."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "So that's a no. What am I supposed to do now?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I don't know, Mako.  Figure it out. Remember? That's what you said to me. Hurts, doesn't it?  Ow! My instrument!"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Are you sure this is a good idea?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "No, but it's our last resort."}, {"speaker": "Triple Threat doorman", "text": "Hey, Mako. Whatever you think we did, we didn't do it."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I'm not here on police business. I'm running an off-the-books operation, and I thought the Triple Threats might want a piece of the action."}, {"speaker": "Triple Threat doorman", "text": "How big a piece?"}, {"speaker": "Viper", "text": "So Mr. Law and Order needs our help, huh? What's in it for the Triple Threats?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I am personal friends with that Avatar. I might be able to convince her to give Shady Shin his bending back."}, {"speaker": "Shady Shin", "text": "Sounds good to me, boss."}, {"speaker": "Viper", "text": "What about the rest of us?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "I've got vehicles, all brand-new and top of the line. They can be yours if you help."}, {"speaker": "Viper", "text": "I think we got ourselves a deal."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "This is right around the area where the attacks happened. So keep your eyes peeled, and stay quiet."}, {"speaker": "Two Toed Ping", "text": "I agree. Keep quiet. Mouth zipped, don't say a word. That's the best thing to do when you're trying to ambush somebody, which is what we're doing here, and it's basically what I'm always doing. I mean, I am a gangster, after all, and -"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Two Toed Ping, please."}, {"speaker": "Two Toed Ping", "text": "Oh, right. So, what's it like dating the Avatar.  Come on, Mako, I gotta know."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Ping, stay focused!"}, {"speaker": "Two Toed Ping", "text": "What? What are you so weird about it? If I was dating the Avatar, I'd tell you all about it."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "There's nothing to know.  I broke up with her."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "You broke up? When? Why didn't you tell me?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I don't know."}, {"speaker": "Two Toed Ping", "text": "Yeah, right. You broke up with the Avatar. Like that happened. Hey, Shady Shin, Viper. Mako says he broke up with the Avatar."}, {"speaker": "Shady Shin", "text": "Sure he did."}, {"speaker": "Viper", "text": "Yeah, I did too."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "All right, would you guys knock it off and do your job?"}, {"speaker": "Assistant director", "text": "And action!"}, {"speaker": "Ginger", "text": "Forget about me. You must capture the evil Unalaq before he gets away."}, {"speaker": "Nuktuk", "text": "No! I'll never leave you."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Cut!  There's no kiss in the script."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Sorry, I just kinda lost myself in the moment.  It just felts so right."}, {"speaker": "Ginger", "text": "Urch."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "It did, huh? Your girlfriend's about to die, and instead of untying her, you kiss her. Wait a minute! Maybe that will work. Yes! It's genius! Everybody take five. Except for you, Zhu Li. Grab the tweezers. I've got some neck-hair issues to resolve."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "So ... that kiss. I liked it. And it seemed like you liked it too."}, {"speaker": "Ginger", "text": "Uch. You're confusing Ginger the actress with Ginger the character."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I'm totally getting, like, a weird vibe from you right now. It's like, a minute ago, when we were shooting, you were into me, but now you're not."}, {"speaker": "Ginger", "text": "That's because Ginger loves Nuktuk, not Bolin."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "But Nuktuk is Bolin. I'm a hero."}, {"speaker": "Two Toed Ping", "text": "And that's why they call me  Two Toed Ping."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Because you have two extra toes."}, {"speaker": "Two Toed Ping", "text": "That's right. And there was already a Twelve Toed Ping on the south side."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Wait, guys. Do you hear that?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "I didn't hear anything."}, {"speaker": "Two Toed Ping", "text": "No."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Ah! What's taking so long?"}, {"speaker": "Two Toed Ping", "text": "You just gotta relax, like me. Maybe try taking your shoes off."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I'm gonna check it out."}, {"speaker": "Shady Shin", "text": "So how long do we have to stay out here?"}, {"speaker": "Viper", "text": "I told you, it's gonna be a few hours. What, do you have a hot date?"}, {"speaker": "Shady Shin", "text": "Actually, I do. And I wanna look my best. I gotta shower and shave. I have a whole routine, okay?"}, {"speaker": "Viper", "text": "Well, your date's gonna have to wait."}, {"speaker": "Shady Shin", "text": "She's not gonna be happy about that."}, {"speaker": "Viper", "text": "Too bad. We were paid to keep Mako and that dame  distracted for a few hours, so that's what we're gonna do."}, {"speaker": "Shady Shin", "text": "See? This is why I never get dates."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I just overheard Shady Shin and Viper. We've been double-crossed. We have to get off this ship."}, {"speaker": "Viper", "text": "Where do you think you're going?"}, {"speaker": "Viper", "text": "Get'm!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "They're getting closer."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Not for long."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Watch out! We're not gonna make it.  One down, one to go."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "We're stalled."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Mako, hang onto something.  What was that all about?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Someone paid the Triple Threats to keep us distracted."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Distracted? From what? Oh no."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Whoever paid the Triple Threats stole everything."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "I'm ruined. My company ... it's over."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "We should check out your other warehouses. Maybe they didn't have time to hit them all."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "You don't understand. Everything I had was in here."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "We have to search the place for evidence. If we can find a lead ..."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Mako ... it doesn't matter anymore."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I can figure this out."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Just stop. It's over. I give up."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Well, I'm not giving up on you."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Sorry, I-"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Uh ... It's-it's okay. Um ... Anyway ... I gotta run. I'm gonna find out who did this. And I know just who to ask."}, {"speaker": "Two Toed Ping", "text": "Hey, Mako. Uh, you're not mad about last night, are you?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Who hired you to double-cross us?"}, {"speaker": "Two Toed Ping", "text": "I don't know."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I think you do know.  And you're gonna tell me, or we're gonna have to change your name to \"No Toed Ping\"."}, {"speaker": "Two Toed Ping", "text": "Really, I don't know. You have to believe me. We never met the guy who hired us."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "You expect me to believe that?"}, {"speaker": "Two Toed Ping", "text": "After you left the hideout, some mook showed up and said his boss would pay us to keep you distracted. We'd never seen him before, and we ain't seen him since. Come on, Mako, you know how these deals work. Please, I would never lie to you with my lucky toes on the line."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Get out of here."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Bolin, have you seen Varrick around? Bolin!  Nuktuk."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Yes? Oh, hello, Mako. Didn't notice you there."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Where's Varrick? I need to ask him something."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Hmm. Can't say that I've seen him. But I've been kinda busy, you know, rehearsing for my big scene. There's gonna be some crazy  \"pyrotechnics\". That's mover speak for explosions."}, {"speaker": "Assistant director", "text": "We need Nuktuk on set. Running explosion scene."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Or sometimes we just call them explosions. Anyway, wish I could stand around here and chitchat, but you know, I gotta go shoot my big scene."}, {"speaker": "Assistant director", "text": "Okay, the set is clear. Camera's rolling. And ... action!"}, {"speaker": "Nuktuk", "text": "Ginger, stay down! I'm coming for you."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "How did you rig those explosions to go off like that?"}, {"speaker": "Pyrotechnics technician", "text": "Neat, huh? It's a Varrick Industries exclusive. Here, check it out.  The explosions use a remote detonator."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Varrick."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Asami, I think I know who set us up."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Hello, Mako."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "What are you doing here?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "He just saved my company.  Varrick bought a controlling interest in Future Industries. Isn't that great?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Yep, I like to think I'm always there to stand up for the little guy. Especially if that little guy can help this guy become a bigger guy."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "So what were you saying, Mako? You think you know who hired the Triple Threats?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Yeah, and I'm real close to proving it.  I'll fill you in later."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Get away from me!"}, {"speaker": "Karu", "text": "It's okay, we're here to help you, Avatar Korra."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Who's-who's \"Avatar Korra\"?"}, {"speaker": "Karu", "text": "What happened to you?

In order to restore it, she has connected with Wan, who would become the very first Avatar. Banished from his home, Wan survived for two years in the Spirit Wilds and learned to master fire. But then, Wan split the spirits of light and dark, Raava and Vaatu, unwittingly plunging the world toward annihilation. Will he be able to stop him?"}, {"speaker": "Karu", "text": "Should we pull her up?"}, {"speaker": "Shaman", "text": "No. She is connecting with her deepest Avatar memories.  She must confront her own past if she is to move forward.  We can only hope that she survives her ordeal."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "The human and spirit realms are headed toward annihilation.  And it's all your fault.  This is why humans have no place  interfering in the business of spirits."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "This world is home to all of us, and what happens here is everyone's business."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "Thanks to you, this world may cease to exist! I only hope I can track down Vaatu before it's too late."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Let me help you."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "I don't want your help.

Um, sorry to interrupt, but it's been a while since I've seen other humans."}, {"speaker": "Nomad", "text": "Where did you come from, stranger?"}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Another lion turtle city far away.

Leave these people in peace. They've done nothing to harm you."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "Be gone."}, {"speaker": "Vaatu", "text": "How are you feeling since our split, Raava? I've never been better. When Harmonic Convergence comes, I will destroy you forever."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "I told you not to interfere."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "I had to do something. These people were in danger."}, {"speaker": "Nomad", "text": "Great spirit of light, we thank you for your help. But how did you become split from Vaatu?"}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "Ask him."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "It wasn't my fault. Vaatu tricked me into freeing him. I'd take it all back if I could."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "It's too late for that. Now that Vaatu is free, he is turning other spirits dark. The more spirits he turns, the stronger he becomes."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "He's getting bigger, and you're getting smaller."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "As darkness grows, light fades."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "I'm sorry for endangering your village, but I promise to set things right."}, {"speaker": "Nomad", "text": "How?"}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Great lion turtle, I ask that you grant me the power of air so that I can defeat Vaatu before it's too late."}, {"speaker": "Air lion turtle", "text": "You already carry the power of fire. No human has ever held two elements at the same time."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "I'm not like other humans. I can learn to do it."}, {"speaker": "Air lion turtle", "text": "Hmm, perhaps. But to do so, Raava must hold the power for you until you master it."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "Ancient one, why would I do that for a human? Especially one who's caused so much trouble?"}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Raava, please, I can't let the world fall into chaos because of my mistake. Neither of us can defeat Vaatu alone, but together we have a chance."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "You may be right. Very well. I will help you to master the power of air."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Thank you. And in return I will help you restore balance to the world."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "What's this harmonic thing Vaatu was talking about?"}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "Harmonic Convergence. That is when Vaatu and I must battle for the fate of the world."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "How long do we have until then?"}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "About a year in your time."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Then we better start training.  All right, I'm ready to try air. How's this gonna work?"}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "The only way for me to give you the other element is to pass through your body and combine our energies."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Great. So you've done this before."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "No. This has never even been attempted. It is very dangerous."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "That's what they said about living in the Spirit Wilds, and I survived that. I'm ready. Give me the air.  It feels completely different. If you and Vaatu have the same fight every ten thousand years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other?"}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "He cannot destroy light any more than I can destroy darkness. One cannot exist without the other. Even if I defeat Vaatu in this encounter, darkness will grow inside me until he emerges again. The same will hold true if Vaatu defeats me."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "That doesn't sound so bad. Even if Vaatu wins, you'll come back."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "Yes, but you will probably not survive to see it. Vaatu will destroy the world as you know it. Darkness will cover the Earth for ten thousand years."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "If I'm gonna help you battle Vaatu, then I should visit more lion turtles.  Why is there so much conflict between humans and spirits in the first place?"}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "This physical world is where humans come from. Spirits come from another realm. At the north and south poles, the two realms intersect. Over time, more and more spirits have drifted into this world.  Humans have been forced apart, settling on the lion turtles who protect them and losing touch with each other."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Most people think they live in the only human city in the world."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "Most humans think only of themselves,  no matter how many others are around."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "When you pass through me, I feel an incredible rush of power.  I feel like I'm changing. The more we practice, the stronger I become.  Smells like smoke."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "Humans are nearby."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Let's check it out."}, {"speaker": "Settler", "text": "A spirit!"}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Easy there, fellas. We're friendly."}, {"speaker": "Jaya", "text": "I can't believe it. Wan?"}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Jaya!  What are you doing out here?"}, {"speaker": "Jaya", "text": "You inspired us. Once we heard that you survived out in the wilds, we decided to try it too."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Where's Yao?  Did he come with you?"}, {"speaker": "Jaya", "text": "Yes, but sadly he didn't make it.  We ... we lost a lot of good men along the way.  So why were you protecting this spirit?"}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "This is Raava. Don't worry. She's not like the dark spirits you've probably run into."}, {"speaker": "Jaya", "text": "Dark spirits? What's the difference? We throw fire at any spirit we see around here. Just like they attack any man."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "You have no idea what you're doing. You're only making things worse."}, {"speaker": "Settler", "text": "The spirits are coming back!"}, {"speaker": "Jaya", "text": "Let's wipe 'em out this time!  We'll burn down this whole forest if we have to!"}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "What happened to you? When did you become so violent?"}, {"speaker": "Jaya", "text": "You showed me we could change the world if we just stopped being so afraid. Now we're doing it."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "This isn't what I had in mind."}, {"speaker": "Aye-aye spirit", "text": "Get out of the forest, humans."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Wait! We can resolve this peacefully."}, {"speaker": "Aye-aye spirit", "text": "Stinky?  You came back."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "It's good to see you again."}, {"speaker": "Aye-aye spirit", "text": "You and Raava are just in time to help us clear these tree-killing fire-lovers out of here just like the old days."}, {"speaker": "Jaya", "text": "You are the one who's getting cleared out."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "There's no need for violence. I know there must be a way to work out a compromise."}, {"speaker": "Aye-aye spirit", "text": "You have a good heart, Stinky. But these fire tossers aren't like you."}, {"speaker": "Jaya", "text": "Spirits like him killed our friends! I can't let them get away with that."}, {"speaker": "Dark aye-aye spirit", "text": "We are protectors of the forest. We won't let you burn it down."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "It's Vaatu. He's growing stronger, using their anger to turn them to his side."}, {"speaker": "Dark aye-aye spirit", "text": "Wipe them out!"}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Stop, please!  Raava, we need to combine our energies. Maybe then we'll have enough power to stop this.  Enough!  You need to stop fighting now,  before you destroy each other!"}, {"speaker": "Aye-aye spirit", "text": "Stinky, w-what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Jaya", "text": "He's controlling all four elements."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "Wan, I have to leave your body, or I'll destroy you."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "No. It's working. If you leave, the fighting will start again."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "Wan!"}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "We have to go back."}, {"speaker": "Vaatu", "text": "Don't bother. Your human friends have already been annihilated."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "No!"}, {"speaker": "Vaatu", "text": "Enjoy your final days. See you at the end of the world!"}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Raava ..."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "I'm sorry, Wan."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "We're almost there.  I was wrong about you, Wan. I had no idea that humans were capable of such nobility and courage. I'm sorry that we do not have much more time together."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Let's not give up before the battle's even begun. Who knows what will happen?  After all, this is my first Harmonic Convergence."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "This is the southern portal to the Spirit World. Here, Vaatu and I will do battle once again, at the place where the two worlds meet."}, {"speaker": "Vaatu", "text": "Are you ready for our final battle, Raava? Thanks to our friend separating us, I think this time I may be rid of you once and for all."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Before you get to her, you'll have to go through me."}, {"speaker": "Vaatu", "text": "No human can stand against me ."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Haven't you heard the legends? I'm not a regular human anymore."}, {"speaker": "Vaatu", "text": "I lived ten thousand lifetimes before the first of your kind crawled out of the mud!"}, {"speaker": "Vaatu", "text": "It was I who broke through the divide that separated the plane of spirits from the material world!  To hate me is to give me breath. To fight me is to give me strength. Now prepare to face oblivion!"}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Raava! The only way to win is together.  Ah!"}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "I have to leave you. If I stay any longer, you will die."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "It doesn't matter. If you leave me now, Vaatu will destroy everything. We have to finish this together!"}, {"speaker": "Vaatu", "text": "The Harmonic Convergence is about to begin. The era of Raava is over."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "We are bonded forever."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "This is your prison now. And I will close the portals so no human will ever be able to physically enter the Spirit World and release you."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "The spirits must stop fighting with humans and return to their home in the Spirit World. I will teach men to respect the spirits so that balance will be maintained."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "I will be the bridge between our two worlds."}, {"speaker": "Fire lion turtle", "text": "The world is entering a new age. Our time protecting mankind is over. We will no longer give humans the power of the elements."}, {"speaker": "Wan", "text": "Different groups of people must learn to live together.  This is my mission: to use Raava's light spirit  to guide the world toward peace."}, {"speaker": "Old Wan", "text": "I'm sorry, Raava. I failed to bring peace. Even with Vaatu locked away, darkness still surrounds humanity.  There wasn't enough time."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "Don't worry. We will be together for all of your lifetimes.

My teapot!"}, {"speaker": "Iroh", "text": "That's right. It was yours long, long ago.  When you were Avatar Wan, you used it to carry the light spirit, Raava, around- until the two of you became one.

I had always enjoyed the company of the spirits,  so when my work was done in the material world,  I chose to leave my body behind and come to the Spirit World! It can be a wonderful place, and I've made so many friends.  Korra, what's wrong?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I came here with my friend, but I lost her and now I'm all alone."}, {"speaker": "Iroh", "text": "You're not alone Korra, it's okay."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No! It's not okay! Jinora's gone and I need to find her! She's lost, and we need to go home!  I don't like the Spirit World, I don't want to be here anymore!"}, {"speaker": "May", "text": "Did you say something to her?"}, {"speaker": "Jim", "text": "Me? You're the one with the big mouth!"}, {"speaker": "Iroh", "text": "Korra, please stop! Look at what you're doing to everyone!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I did that?"}, {"speaker": "Iroh", "text": "In the Spirit World, your emotions become your reality- especially for the Avatar, because you are the bridge between the two worlds. You must try to stay positive."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm sorry."}, {"speaker": "Iroh", "text": "There, you see?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I can make the sun shine?"}, {"speaker": "Iroh", "text": "Even in the material world, you will find that if you look for the light, you can often find it. But if you look for the dark,  that is all you will ever see."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm looking for my friend. I want her here now!  Why didn't she come out like the sun?"}, {"speaker": "Iroh", "text": "I'm afraid finding her won't be so easy."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "But what am I supposed to do?"}, {"speaker": "Iroh", "text": "Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else.  This little fellow needs to go home as well. Maybe if you help him find his friends, you will be able to find yours."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'll take him home! Where do I go?"}, {"speaker": "Iroh", "text": "The dragon bird nest is located there, at the top of Hai-Riyo Peak."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Ugh, it's not in here either! I have to find the portals. Korra is probably waiting for me there right now! I need to find a map that shows where the spirit portals are, could you help me? Thanks, this is it! The Tree of Time! That's where Avatar Wan imprisoned Vaatu! The elders believe that as long as the portals are closed during the Harmonic Convergence, Vaatu will remain imprisoned and the battle between good and evil will not be fought again. But, if both portals are open, spirit energy is amplified greatly. During the Harmonic Convergence, this energy will be great enough to allow Vaatu to break free from his bonds, and the material world will again risk being consumed by darkness. We have to warn Korra!"}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "Leaving so soon? When Wan Shi Tong told me he had a visitor, I had to see it with my own eyes. I can't believe Tenzin sent his daughter here instead of coming himself - what kind of a father is he?"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Better than you. Wan Shi Tong, how can you be helping him?"}, {"speaker": "Wan Shi Tong", "text": "Unalaq has proven to be a true friend to the spirits - unlike the Avatar."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Why would you wanna help Vaatu escape? He'll destroy everything!"}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "Don't believe everything you read. Why don't you come with me, so you can do some firsthand research?"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Furry-Foot ...?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "This looks scary. Will you come with me?"}, {"speaker": "Iroh", "text": "This is something that you must do on your own. The people who have been coming to the Spirit World lately have brought darkness and anger. So that is what you see now. But you have light and peace inside of you. If you let it out, you can change the world around you. Besides, look at this little fellow. This mountain is his home. When you first met him, you were frightened. But does he seem scary to you now?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No!"}, {"speaker": "Iroh", "text": "Many things that seem threatening in the dark become welcoming when we shine light on them. It was good to meet you. Come visit me again - in this life, or the next."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Bye! Okay, time for you to go home. Light and peace ... light and peace ..."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm not afraid of you. You're not scary! You just look that way. I have light inside! It's okay, you can be my friends. My name is Korra, and I'm taking this dragon bird home! Iroh said you could be nice. Do you wanna help me? All right, now let's close that portal and go find Jinora."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "That's where Vaatu is."}, {"speaker": "Vaatu", "text": "So you've returned, Raava. The Harmonic Convergence is coming soon, and this time, I'm going to wipe you out for good ."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I think you've said that before, Vaatu. But I'm here to close the portal. You're not getting out."}, {"speaker": "Vaatu", "text": "You might want to reconsider- that is if you want to save your friend."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Jinora!  I can't believe I trusted you! You made me think you wanted to restore balance with spirits, but this- this isn't balance, it's madness! Now let her go!"}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "If you want your friend to make it out of the Spirit World, you'll open the other portal now ."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Don't do it Korra!"}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "What will it be? Open the portal- or lose your friend's soul forever?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Stop! I'll do it.  Now let Jinora go. Ahhh!"}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "You should've come through the portal. Then you could do this!"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Ahhh! Korra!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Ahhh!"}, {"speaker": "Vaatu", "text": "I'll see you soon, Raava. Once the Harmonic Convergence comes, I'll be free from this prison, and then I will have my revenge !"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Korra! What was it like? Did you manage to close the portal? Was Jinora able to help you?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Tenzin- I'm ... I'm sorry."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Where's Jinora? W-Why isn't she waking up? Korra!

What do you think?  No expense has been spared, I brought in the finest entertainers from Ba Sing Se, and the best food from around the world. Heck! I even had this red carpet imported from the Fire Nation! They make the best red stuff over there. Fact! All right, picture time."}, {"speaker": "Raiko", "text": "Varrick, you didn't have to do all this for us."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "I wanted to. Mister President, I took one look at your wife and I knew that you were a man of exquisite taste.

You know, when I first started this project there were a lot of naysayers out there. \"You can't make pictures move\" they said. \"You can't take some knucklehead earthbender and make him a star\" they said.  \"You can't teach a polar bear dog to speak\" they said. Well, they're wrong ! Thanks to the magic of the movers, our furry friends have found their voices, and you'll be shocked to hear what they have to say.  They speak of the injustice that is happening in the Southern Water Tribe right now.  My hope, is that their words, and this epic mover, will inspire a real life hero to rise up, and help.  Thank you again, enjoy the show!"}, {"speaker": "Voice narrator", "text": "When last we left our hero, he was captured by the Evil Unalaq's dastardly pet bird.

Spoiler. Sorry."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Then what's wrong?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I guess I just miss my friends.

What's wrong?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Sir, I know I've asked for your help before, but things have changed. Unalaq doesn't just wanna take over the South anymore. He wants to destroy the whole world."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Unalaq is going to destroy the world? He really does have a doomsday device?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "He's trying to release a powerful dark spirit during Harmonic Convergence, which is only a few days away. If he succeeds, the world as we know it, is over. Sir, we desperately need your help."}, {"speaker": "Raiko", "text": "I'm sorry, Korra, but my answer is still no."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "There are lives on the line! And my daughter is one of them! Raiko, you must reconsider!"}, {"speaker": "Raiko", "text": "I'm aware that lives are on the line. And that's precisely why my troops are staying here. If the world is going to be thrown into chaos as you claim, I need to protect my citizens. I'm sorry."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Sir, Nuktuk needs your help. I know you love helping people."}, {"speaker": "Raiko", "text": "Son, I appreciate you saving my life and I'm a big fan of your work, but my decision is final."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Never should have saved that guy."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "If you guys need help, I'm here for you."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Yeah, me too."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Thank you. It's so good to see you guys again.  Wait. Where's Mako?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "So, how was the big premiere?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I saved the president, in real life!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Wait, wh-what?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "You were right about Varrick. He tried to kidnap Raiko!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I knew it!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "But it didn't work, because of you, and because of me. Let's just say we both did good. Beifong says you're free to go.  Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Don't worry about it bro."}, {"speaker": "Lin Beifong", "text": "Nice job, Mako. You're going to make a great detective."}, {"speaker": "Gang", "text": "But chief, there aren't any detective openings right now."}, {"speaker": "Lin Beifong", "text": "Actually we have two openings."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Mako, I've missed you so much."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Oh yeah, did I forget to tell you? Korra's back."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Korra ... hey, I missed you, too. So you're not still mad at me?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Why would I be mad?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "We had that fight before you left, remember?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No, not really. I got attacked by a dark spirit and I lost my memory for a little while. Maybe it hasn't all come back yet. Was it a bad fight?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Uh ...  No. No, it wasn't that bad."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Korra, we don't have much time. We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I think I know just the man to talk to."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Guys, hey,  what do you think? Varrick Industries built this prison, and I had this cell made special. I had a feeling I'd end up here one day.  Zhu Li, c'mon, we got guests!  Whip up a pot of that green tea I love!"}, {"speaker": "Zhu Li", "text": "Yes, sir."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Zhu Li's in prison with you?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Of course! I don't go anywhere without my assistant. Do you?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "We're not interested in your tea. And this isn't a friendly visit."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Don't tell me you guys are still mad about everything that happened. I did some good things, too.  Korra, who warned you about Unalaq?  I did.  Bolin, who got you into the movers?  I did.  Asami, who saved your company?  I did.  Mako, who got you thrown in jail!?  I did!  Oh yeah, guess that was a bad thing."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "You stole everything from me and you tried to kidnap the president. Those are pretty bad, too."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "I wasn't going to hurt him. I just needed to start a war. Well, a bigger war."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Well we're gonna end it. Where's all the stuff you stole from Asami?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "The Future Industries' stuff? It's on my battleship."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You have a battleship?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Of course I do! I bought the first one they made! Named her the \"Zhu Li\"."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "You named your battleship after your assistant?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Yup. They're both cold, heartless war machines."}, {"speaker": "Zhu Li", "text": "Your tea, sir."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Look, I'm truly sorry for the mess I caused. Let me make it up to you,  take Zhu Li.  My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "It's not the fleet we were looking for, but it's the next best thing."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "All right! Team Avatar is back in business. Haha!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "It's okay. We're going to stop Unalaq, and get Jinora back."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I hope my dad's all right."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I'm sure he's fine."}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "Get the men and fall back."}, {"speaker": "Rebel", "text": "What about you?"}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "I'm going to end this, right now.

Of course, there's also the catgator deck.  I miss that guy, he really knew how to make a long trip interesting. So, have you told Korra yet about how  you guys broke up, and you kinda started dating Asami while she was off getting attacked by dark spirits?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Will you keep it down? I'm waiting for the right moment."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Oh Mako, you know a wise man once told me that delivering bad news to a girlfriend was like ripping off a blood-sucking leech: you just have to do it fast and get it over with."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I hate it when you listen to me. Fine!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Unalaq will be waiting for you.

Um ..."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Did you want something?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Uh no, no, nothing."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "As soon as we reach the Southern Water Tribe, we'll blast through the blockade at the main portal.  Then we can rendezvous with Tonraq and his troops, crash through the defenses around the portal, and enter the Spirit World."}, {"speaker": "Kya", "text": "Woah! Since when does my little brother wanna crash or blast through anything?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I'll do whatever it takes to save my daughter."}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "We all want to save Jinora, but I think your plan might be a tad over-aggressive, seeing as there are only seven of us and one ship."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Really? And what do you suggest?"}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "An attack like this calls for strategy. I remember when I was surrounded by pirates at the Hurricane Straits.

So I fashioned together a catapult, and with the help of a few well-trained hog monkeys ..."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Enough of your ridiculous lies! Can't you see that the fate of the world and Jinora's life depends on what we do here today?!"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Hold on, maybe Bumi's right.  We don't have a catapult and hog monkeys, but we have a flying bison and there's a plane on Varrick's ship. Maybe we can attack from above."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What are you thinking?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Mako, Bolin and I can use the plane to create a distraction, and scatter some of the defenses. You, Tenzin, Bumi and Kya can fly into the spirit portal on Oogi when you see an opening."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Let's get moving."}, {"speaker": "Eska", "text": "What are we still doing here, Father?"}, {"speaker": "Desna", "text": "The invasion was completely successful and the southern tribe is under our control.

You've all got front row seats for the beginning of a new world order."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You don't know what you're doing, Unalaq. Freeing Vaatu won't make you powerful, it will only make you a traitor to everything good that's happened over the last ten thousand years."}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "You think what Avatar Wan did was good? Driving almost all the spirits from this world? The Avatar hasn't brought balance, only chaos. You call yourself the bridge between the two worlds,  but there shouldn't be a bridge: we should live together as one."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Even if Vaatu escapes, I'll put him right back in his prison, just like Wan did."}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "It's true that when Wan fused with Raava he tipped the scales in her favor, but this time I'll be here to level the playing field.

I know that you've always had a deep connection with the spirits, but you're still a man. You're still my brother, you're Eska and Desna's father. Are you willing to throw your humanity away to become a monster?"}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "I'll be no more of a monster than your own daughter. The only difference is that while she can barely recognize her own spiritual power, I will be in complete alignment with mine. Vaatu and I will be as one. No one will be able to stand against us.  Keep them locked up. After the Harmonic Convergence, I will come for Korra."}, {"speaker": "Eska", "text": "Yes, Father."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I failed in every way.

Oh, we're playing dirty, huh?"}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "Hmm ... Looks like we've got a music lover here.  Reinforcements!  All right, soldiers, looks like it's on us to save the day, luckily I've got a plan."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Eska, Desna, listen to me.  You've got to help us stop Unalaq. I know he's your father, but Vaatu has made him completely crazy."}, {"speaker": "Eska", "text": "We will never turn on our father."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Please.  If you let me out now, I can still stop him from destroying everything.  Once he fuses with Vaatu, no one will be safe. Desna, he won't be your father anymore."}, {"speaker": "Desna", "text": "You don't know what you're talking about!  Our father is the wisest man in the world. If he says what he is doing is right, I believe him."}, {"speaker": "Northern soldier 1", "text": "Huh?"}, {"speaker": "Northern soldier 2", "text": "You know, if I wanted some ball of evil lurking over my shoulder all the time, I'd have stayed home with my mother-in-law."}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "All right, spirit army.  Your general is here. Follow me!  It's working!  It's not working!"}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "Get me out of here!"}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "All right guys, rescue time."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Bumi, how did you manage to take out this entire encampment on your own?"}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "I did it all with my trusty flute and ... ah, never mind, you wouldn't believe it anyway. Let's get moving."}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "You run into the portal, I'll try to hold off anyone who comes after you."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No, you're too hurt, you need a healer.  Asami, can you take Oogi and my dad back to my mom?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Mhmm."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "This is my fight now."}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "Korra,  I love you."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I love you too, Dad."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Yip-yip."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Once we're inside, you go find Jinora.

Worst-case scenario: so we're fighting Unalaq, you close the portals and let's just say something happens to you. Are we going to be trapped in there for eternity?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "If everything goes as planned, we'll all walk out together after Harmonic Convergence.  If not ...

I've realized that even though we should learn from those who came before us, we must also forge our own path. So that is why I've decided to keep the portals open. Humans can now physically enter the Spirit World, and spirits will be free to roam our world. I will no longer be the bridge. Humans and spirits must learn to live together. My mission will always be to use Raava's light spirit to guide the world toward peace and balance. Harmonic Convergence has caused a shift in the planet's energy. I can feel it.

Why? Why? I can't go on, I ca--\"  and then she dies."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Okay, all right,  I'll come with you. I guess I gotta call Beifong. She's not going to be happy."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Bye! We'll miss you!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "As of now, these are the towns where we've gotten reports about airbenders.

Our shift change is here."}, {"speaker": "White Lotus sentry", "text": "Hey! Where are the other guards?"}, {"speaker": "White Lotus sentry", "text": "Zaheer?!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "It's nice to see you again, Ghazan."}, {"speaker": "Ghazan", "text": "Thanks for busting me out. Where did you pick up the new skills?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "I have Harmonic Convergence to thank for that. I was given a gift. I believe it's a sign that our path is a righteous one."}, {"speaker": "Townsman", "text": "Avatar Korra! Oh it's such an honor to have you come to our humble village."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Thanks."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I hate to get down to business, but is the airbender here now?"}, {"speaker": "Townsman", "text": "Kuon and his family will be joining us shortly for a special dinner. Please, right this way.  Kuon has been the talk of the town ever since he's got airbending; he's like a local celebrity."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I just want to say it's an honor to meet a fellow airbender."}, {"speaker": "Kuon", "text": "Oh, I still think of myself as a simple farmer. Who can airbend!  Oh, I'm so sorry! I still don't have any control."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "No worries! I love pie. And so does Pabu."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Well, you're so much more than just a farmer now. Harmonic Convergence changed everything. You represent the future of a culture that is being reborn. You're going to help us rebuild the Air Nation."}, {"speaker": "Kuon", "text": "I'm gonna do what now? The only thing I'm planning to rebuild is my barn."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "But you must come with us to the Northern Air Temple."}, {"speaker": "Kuon", "text": "Well, I can't do that. I have a family and a farm."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Of course you can come. This is of the utmost importance. Your wife will understand."}, {"speaker": "Kuon's wife", "text": "Wait, what? No, I do not understand."}, {"speaker": "Kuon's daughter", "text": "Daddy, where are you going? Why does the bald man want to take you away?"}, {"speaker": "Kuon's wife", "text": "No one's going to take Daddy away, sweetheart."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Actually, this bald man does want to take him, but it's for an important cause. Your dad is an airbender, and he should learn about his culture."}, {"speaker": "Kuon", "text": "I think there's been some sort of misunderstanding. I'm not going with you. I might be able to airbend, but I'm no Air Nomad, I'm no monk."}, {"speaker": "Townsman", "text": "Okay, maybe we should just have some dessert huh? Who's up for dessert?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Sir, you must understand, you're an airbender now, and there are thousands of years of culture you must learn about, skills you must master."}, {"speaker": "Kuon", "text": "You expect me to abandon my entire life? My family?  No! No sir, I'm not going anywhere with you and I think it's best that you leave."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "In my head, I saw that playing out very differently."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Maybe we should have stayed and tried harder to convince him to join us."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Or we could have thrown him in a potato sack and forced him into the ship."}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "That's how they got me to join the United Forces."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "No, we can't coerce people, or throw them in potato sacks. They must come freely. But not to worry, there are plenty of other airbenders out there who will be happy to come with us once they find out what the Air Nation is all about."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "When your son becomes a master, he'll have tattoos all over his body, just like me.  There's nothing more nutritious than our vegetarian diet.  I can tell that you're going to love wearing our ancient airbender robes. They're very breathable.  You'll never have to worry about your worldly possessions again, because you won't have any.  You'll get to shave your head.  Your best friend will be a giant bison!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Ugh, I really thought I had that last guy. Who doesn't want a bison as their best friend?"}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "It's okay Tenzin, I still want to be an airbender."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Okay, we've tried it your way, and people just don't seem to be responding. It's time for a little tough love."}, {"speaker": "Ryu's mother", "text": "Oh, are you the Avatar? When my son got airbending, my husband and I were so happy. We thought this could open a lot of doors for him, maybe he could finally move out of the basement."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "How old is he?"}, {"speaker": "Ryu's mother", "text": "He's twenty-two, and you know, still just to figuring his life out."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Well, I have a great opportunity for him. We're looking for airbenders to join us at the Northern Air Temple."}, {"speaker": "Ryu's mother", "text": "Ah, that sounds wonderful! I'll get him.  Ryu! Get up here!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Hi, I'm Korra."}, {"speaker": "Ryu", "text": "So you're like the Avatar or something. Big deal."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Uh, I just wanted to talk to you about an opportunity."}, {"speaker": "Ryu", "text": "Yeah, I heard you talking to my mom, and I'm not interested."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Well, you're gonna be interested."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You're an airbender now and you have a responsibility as a citizen of the world."}, {"speaker": "Ryu", "text": "Whatever. I didn't ask to become an airbender, you know."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Well, I didn't ask to be the Avatar, but I am, and I'm fulfilling my duties."}, {"speaker": "Ryu", "text": "So? You don't have to."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Yes, I do have to."}, {"speaker": "Ryu", "text": "No, you don't."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Yes, I do!"}, {"speaker": "Ryu", "text": "No, you don't."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Well,  if I didn't embrace my role, then our entire world could be thrown into chaos. Think about that! Is that what you want?"}, {"speaker": "Ryu", "text": "Maybe."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No, it's not!"}, {"speaker": "Ryu", "text": "So what? Who cares?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Everyone cares!"}, {"speaker": "Ryu", "text": "I don't care."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Yes, you do!"}, {"speaker": "Ryu", "text": "No, I don't."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Well, you're about to care, you little slacker, because you're coming with me!"}, {"speaker": "Ryu", "text": "Stop pulling on my collar! You're stretching it out! Mom, are you just gonna let her take me?!"}, {"speaker": "Ryu's mother", "text": "I think it's a great opportunity. Just try it for a week and see how it goes."}, {"speaker": "Ryu", "text": "No! Let me go!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "That's it!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Korra, enough!

I just thought more people would be excited about coming with us."}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "Well, maybe you gotta do more to get them excited. You need to add a little razzle-dazzle."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Yeah, razzle-dazzle! We could put on some sort of airbending street performance!"}, {"speaker": "Bumi", "text": "I was gonna say we could cover Tenzin's robe in sequins, but that's even better!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "It sounds ridiculous, but it might work."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I'm willing to try anything at this point."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Yes! That is the kind of enthusiasm I like to hear!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Come one, come all to witness The Amazing Airbenders! The airbending show that will leave you breathless ... with wind!

Let's go right now."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "This is going to be so great!  You going to love it, er ... ah ... real quick, what's your name?"}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "Kai. So when do we hit the road?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Hang on a second Kai, where are your parents?

My home town was raided by outlaws, but my parents fought back against them. I was so scared, but they told me not to worry they would protect me, and they did.

Those same outlaws are still after me."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Well, you don't have to be on the run anymore,  right guys? Tell him."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I'm so sorry about your parents.

I want the truth."}, {"speaker": "Earth Kingdom sheriff", "text": "The truth is, he's the outlaw.

He never gets my cuffs right. They're so ... crease-y."}, {"speaker": "Zuko", "text": "We built this place secretly with your father to hold a very special prisoner.

Yeah!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "So why did Dad leave Ba Sing Se?"}, {"speaker": "Chow", "text": "Oh, he always had big dreams. He couldn't wait to get out and see the world. Your grandfather thought it was ridiculous. He wanted San to stay home and work the fruit stand. But San was determined to leave, and they had a huge fight.  And that was the last time they ever spoke.  Oh, um ... sorry, Mom."}, {"speaker": "Yin", "text": "Come with me. I have something to show you."}, {"speaker": "Yin", "text": "This is the only letter we ever got from San. It says he married a beautiful girl from the Fire Nation, and had two wonderful sons. He sent this picture of you all on his birthday."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Look, Mako! Dad's wearing your scarf!"}, {"speaker": "Yin", "text": "I'm so sad that I never got to meet your mother,  but you have her eyes.

The Avatar has returned with the tax payments."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "Finally. Secure it in the vault."}, {"speaker": "Gun", "text": "It's being done as we speak."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "So now, Your Majesty, if I could start meeting some of the airbenders here in the city."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "The Dai Li thoroughly searched the city, but it seems your reports were incorrect. There are no airbenders in Ba Sing Se. So, you can gather your little band and be on your way tomorrow."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You make me do your dirty work extorting your own citizens for your stupid palaces and topiaries and then you just want to send me away? We're not going anywhere until we find some airbenders! We know there are some here!"}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "Get her out of my sight!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "This isn't over! I'm going to find the airbenders!"}, {"speaker": "Chow", "text": "You know, San would've been so proud of you guys! Traveling the world with the Avatar? He would've loved that!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "We actually need to get back to the Avatar in the Upper Ring. We're supposed to be helping her find airbenders in Ba Sing Se."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "What? What happened?"}, {"speaker": "Chow", "text": "One of our neighbors started airbending about a week ago. A couple days later, two Dai Li agents come out of nowhere and snatch him up. No one's seen him since."}, {"speaker": "Tu", "text": "They say the Earth Queen's locking all the airbenders up somewhere, and using them for experiments."}, {"speaker": "Yin", "text": "Tu! Don't talk like that about Her Majesty!  Long may she reign."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "We have to get back to the Upper Ring and tell Korra."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I hope Kai is okay."}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "Here, sir, let me help you."}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "Hey!

These criminals are like nothing you've ever faced before."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Look, I'm not a little kid anymore. You don't need to protect me.

Where are they?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "A city called Zaofu,  the home of the Metal Clan."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You know the place?"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Uhh ... Never been there.  But I don't want you going there. I would rest a lot easier if you were back at Republic City."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Sorry, if there's an airbender in Zaofu, then that's where we are going next."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Wow! Wow! Wow!  An entire city made of metal! Wohoho,  you should feel right at home, Beifong."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Hmm ..."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Yeah!"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Aren't you coming?"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "What's there to see? It's metal. Big whoop. Just find the airbender and let's get moving.

I mean ..."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Oh ..."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "How did you know I was lying?"}, {"speaker": "Aiwei", "text": "I'm a truth seer.

We're blood, Lin, and after thirty years, the least you could do is say \"hello\"."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "I have nothing to say to you."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You two haven't spoken in thirty years? How come?"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Ask her, I've tried."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Oh, don't put that on me.

Terrific."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Those are my two youngest, Wei and Wing. They're playing a game called Power Disc. They invented it all on their own."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Oh, nice power, Wei."}, {"speaker": "Wei", "text": "Ha! Wing goes down!"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "I'm so proud of those two.  Huan, I'd like you to meet the Avatar and her friends.

Obviously."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Oh, yeah, no, uh, I can, I can totally see that.  I can, oh, let me stand here. Yes, I can see that now. Yes. Thank you.  Banana.  I mean, that's a banana right?"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "And this is my daughter, Opal."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Wow, Avatar Korra.  I can't believe you're here. You are so amazing."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "It's great to meet you, Opal."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Opal. That's a beautiful name."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Thanks."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I'm Bolin."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Opal.  But, uh, you already knew that."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Great. We've found the airbender. Let's take her back to the airship and get out of here."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "And the woman apparently trying to abduct you is your aunt Lin."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Really? I've always wanted to meet you. My mom has told so many stories about you."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "I'm sure she has."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "So I've set all of you up in the guesthouses while Korra trains Opal."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Oh, I'm sorry. But I was hoping she could train with the rest of the airbenders at the Northern Temple."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "That sounds amazing."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Nonsense. This is where Opal's home and family are. You can train her here."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I guess I could help her get started."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Absolutely not! We're leaving."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "She's just a little worried because there's a bunch of crazy criminals after me."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "If you're concerned about security, don't be. This is the safest city in the world.  Now I'll see you all at dinner. And come hungry. My chef will blow the taste buds right out of your mouth."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Why do you have such a problem with your sister? She seems nice.  Come on, we can stay a little while."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Okay. Let's see what you've got."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "I'm not very good."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "That's okay. I've never been a teacher before, so we're in the same boat.  You'd want to keep your elbows in, torso straight, feet just skimming the ground. Why don't you try it with me?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Woah. You're a natural."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "You really think so? Thanks."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "You call yourself an airbender? Disgraceful!"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Be the leaf!"}, {"speaker": "Daw", "text": "But, I don't even know what that means."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Now, that man is a leaf."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "A student is only  as good as his master."}, {"speaker": "Kya", "text": "Great news! I just got a message from Tenzin. He's with a whole group of other airbenders at the Northern Temple and he wants all of you to join them.  We leave first thing in the morning."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "And the Avatar is with him?"}, {"speaker": "Kya", "text": "No. Apparently she had to split off from Tenzin."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "That's unfortunate. I was really looking forward to meeting her."}, {"speaker": "Chef", "text": "Tonight, for your dining pleasure, I present a seared wild Kyoshi elephant koi, paired with a ginger-infused pea tendril and hibiscus root salad."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Stunning."}, {"speaker": "Baatar", "text": "Sorry, dear, I'm going to have to take dinner to my office. I just had a major breakthrough on the tram station remodel."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Well, don't let me stand away an inspiration."}, {"speaker": "Baatar", "text": "You're the best!"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "That was my brilliant architect of a husband, Baatar, and our oldest son. He engineers all my husband's projects."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Five kids. What a nightmare."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "No, no. My children are a blessing."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Yeah, mom used to say that too, but she never meant it."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Mmmm. I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical when he said \"pea tendrils\",  but this is delicious."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "I know, right. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal in my life."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Oh. I had plenty when Mako and I were living in the streets.  I mean, you'd be surprised how bad food from a dumpster can be."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "I'm sorry. I didn't know."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "No, no, it's okay, that's all in the past. Things are great now. I got to be a pro-bender, fought against a dangerous revolution, became a mover star , and now, I'm helping the Avatar rebuild a whole nation."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Wow. Your life sounds so exciting."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "How's your search for the new airbenders going?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Honestly, not great. We had to rescue a whole group of them from the Earth Queen."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Oh, she's horrible. She thinks she can just do whatever she wants."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Sounds familiar."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "What?"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Nothing."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "I mean, the idea of even having a queen is so outdated. Don't you agree, Korra?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I ... I haven't really thought about it too much."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Well, you should start. The world is evolving and the Earth Queen can evolve with it or step aside."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Hey, everyone. My little sister is an expert on world affairs now."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "You want to talk about what's really bugging you? Because I'm right here!"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Sorry we're late, everyone."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Varrick!"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "What are you doing here?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Great question, Asami. I mean, what are any of us doing here? Wow, food for thought. Any who, how's our company doing?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "You mean my company. Future Industries reverted back to me after you plotted to abduct the President."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Allegedly plotted to abduct the President. Never convicted."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Uh, that's because you escaped prison."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "No, the universe decided to set me free. So, I looked up my old friend Suyin here, pitched her a few ideas,  and bam ! We're in business together."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Varrick's heading up my new technology division."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "I've seen the future, and the future is, magnets ! I'm working on a high speed rail that would revolutionize transportation and shipping as we know it. But that's not all, I'm-"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "All right, enough!  I'm trying to keep the Avatar safe and you're harboring a criminal?"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Ease out, Lin. Sure Varrick's made a few mistakes in his past, but that doesn't mean he should pay for it for the rest of his life. My chef was a pirate, but now he's a culinary master. People change."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "You haven't."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Lin!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "So, you and Opal seemed to hit it off dinner. I think she's really into you."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Yeah, I know. She's sweet and pretty and super nice. Too bad she's not my type."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Right, I forgot. Your type is dumb mover star or psycho ice princess."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "You know, that really hurts a little bit. Right ...  here.  Maybe you're right, bro. Maybe Opal is Bolin material. Thanks.  Yeah!"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "You know, before I built this city, there was nothing here. I wanted to make my mark on the world."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "It's amazing. Thank you for being so welcoming. And I'm sorry for how Lin's been acting. Can I ask what happened with you two?"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "It's complicated. We didn't have a normal childhood. Neither of us knew our fathers and Toph was always busy being Chief of Police. Because mom grew up in such a strict household, she gave us all the freedom in the world, hoping we'd figure out our own paths."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "That sounds like a good thing."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "And in a way it was. But we both ended up fighting for mom's attention. Lin followed in her footsteps and became a cop. I was ... more of a rebel. Mom wasn't too happy with how either of us turned out. When I was sixteen, I left home to explore the world.  I sailed the seas on a pirate ship, joined a traveling circus for a while, and lived in a sandbender commune in a desert. It took me a while, but, I finally realized what I was looking for was a family.

You can't cover this up! There are witnesses."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "I'm the Chief of Police!

You're the first metalbending Avatar."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "So, umm, I've been thinking, and I'd like to try to learn metalbending.  I mean, I'm sure you have a waiting list or something of a couple years so."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Let's get started."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I think Lin is mad about something."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Su, it's time we talk."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "After thirty years, you're finally ready to talk?"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "When we were in Mom's office that day, you could've taken responsibility for what you did.

She was a hero."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "You think she wanted to retire? She was so guilt-ridden about what she did to protect you that she didn't feel worthy of her badge."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Look, I admit that I was not a perfect kid and I've made some mistakes in the past but-"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "You made some mistakes?"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Lin, Mom and I already talked about this years ago and worked things out. If you had gotten together with us like we'd asked, you would know that I'm a different person now. I've been a different person for a long time."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "You think that just because you live in a big, fancy house, and have a chef who cooks you fancy food, that you're a different person? Maybe you could fool everyone else, but you can't fool me. I see right through you."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "You know what, Lin? You're the one who hasn't changed. You're still a bitter loner who only cares about herself. No wonder Tenzin ended things with you years ago."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Okay,  I guess this is how it's going to be."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Should I stop them?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "You don't have any siblings, fighting is all part of the healing process."}, {"speaker": "Wei", "text": "Go Mom!"}, {"speaker": "Huan", "text": "My sculpture!

You're sisters! Why would you want to hurt each other?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Uhh, Whose going to knock?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "No, no, no, no, no, no! Not me! You're the Avatar, why can't you do it?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Uhh, I can. But I just thought that ..."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I'll do it.  Uhh, Chief, you've been sleeping for sixteen hours. We just wanted to make sure that you're okay."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Good morning."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "What's this?"}, {"speaker": "Chef", "text": "I call it the kalenutsco. It's a mixture of kale, coconut water, and walnuts."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Not bad!  Opal, don't go. Please sit down, I want to talk to you.  Look, I'm just not really comfortable talking about these kinds of things, and ... well, I wanted to say that I'm sorry about the other night."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "It's okay."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Your mother and I have a complicated relationship and ..."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "It's probably difficult for you to be here."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "You're a smart young woman, and an excellent airbender.

I don't want to upset my mom."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "When I was younger, all I wanted to do was please my mother. I became a police chief because I thought it would make her happy ... but it didn't. You need to make your decisions based on what you want. Don't make the same mistakes as I did."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Mom, Dad, can I talk to you?"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Opal has decided to go to the Northern Air Temple. I guess you had something to do with her decision."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Well, I was just ..."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "It's okay. I'm glad she was honest with me. I want her to do what makes her happy. Mom gave us too much freedom, but I feel like I made the mistake of giving Opal too little. I think it's about time I let her choose her own way.  I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time when we were younger. I can't imagine what my life would've been like if Mom hadn't sent me away, if I had stayed in the city ..."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "You'd probably be in prison."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "You're probably right. Mako told me that you're an excellent police chief. Republic City is lucky to have you. I know Mom is proud.  Can we move on? I'd love for you to be part of my life again. There's plenty of space in the house, and the kids would love having their aunt around. I do need a new co-director for my new dance performance."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Whoa! Slow it down. How about for now, I just promise not to show up at your house and attack you again?"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Deal!"}, {"speaker": "Ming-Hua", "text": "We should've grabbed one of those cops.

It's pretty overwhelming."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Maybe a little too overwhelming?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Hey, Varrick. What are you doing here?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Collecting pumice stones with Zhu Li. That lavabender did a lot of damage, but he makes a nice exfoliating rock, and when you got callouses like mine, you take all the pumice stones you can get your hands on. Or in my case, feet ."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "What were you saying about the evidence?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "I was saying that I can smell a conspiracy when I see one. Look, if I was trying to set someone up, I would tell everyone he's guilty and then plant the evidence in his apartment as proof."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Oh, you mean exactly like what you did to me?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Yes, just like that! Remember how great that worked? Well, not for you."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "You're right. All the evidence points to this guard, but maybe he's just the fallback."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "But for who?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "For the only person who can truly keep a secret in this city: Aiwei."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "He's not home. Or he's hiding in there.  Or he's invisible.  Probably just not home."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "We have to get in there and find some evidence that links Aiwei to Zaheer, otherwise Su won't believe us."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "It's just an empty book."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Hmm, it's like a desert on a jar."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Bolin, put that back! We don't want Aiwei to know we were in here if we can't find anything.  You forgot where it goes, didn't you?  These look like scuff marks. I think this bookshelf slides open."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What do you think is down there?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Could be a storage cellar."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Or it could be how Zaheer got in and out."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Aiwei's coming back! Quick."}, {"speaker": "Aiwei", "text": "What are doing in my house? You are trespassing on the property of one of the highest-ranked officials in the city. You'd better have a good explanation."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "We do. We do. We actually knocked on your front door and we thought we heard you say,  'Come in, I'm in the bathroom!'  I don't even know why I'm saying that. You know I'm lying, and you don't even sound like that."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "We came here because things weren't adding up, and we thought you might have some answers."}, {"speaker": "Aiwei", "text": "Sit. If you want to talk, let's talk over some tea.  Now, what is not adding up exactly? Hong Li was clearly lying and we found evidence in his apartment."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "But don't you think it's weird how young he is? How did he ever get mixed up with this group?"}, {"speaker": "Aiwei", "text": "Perhaps through a relative, or maybe he was bribed. We will find out those answers in time. But if wasn't him, who do you think it was?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "We don't know."}, {"speaker": "Aiwei", "text": "You don't think I had something to do with this, do you?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "We're just looking for answers."}, {"speaker": "Aiwei", "text": "And you think you've found something, don't you?  You have no idea what is coming for you, Avatar."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Come on, he's getting away!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm still a little new at this, so back off!  Ugh!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "He's gone."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Look, he must've escaped through there! Help me clear it out."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "What happened? We heard an explosion."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Where's Aiwei?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Your trusted adviser is the one who betrayed us. He was lying about the guard."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "What? No!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "We confronted him and he bolted through here."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "He must have collapsed the tunnel behind him."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "And he rigged an explosion to destroy any evidence that might have been here."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "This is where Zaheer got in and out. Aiwei was the traitor."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "I ... trusted him."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Is everyone okay?"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Aiwei is a fugitive. Get all available guards to search the mountainside, and find out where this tunnel exits immediately!"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "What did you find?"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "We located the end of the tunnel, but there's no sign of him. Just some fresh tire tracks."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "He had an escape plan all ready to go."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "I trusted him with my life. I thought we were family, but it was all a lie."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Whoever these guys are, they're more powerful than we thought, and more dangerous."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "That's why we have to find them. We're going to hold off our search for airbenders and hunt down Aiwei. Naga can track his scent."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "And I bet if we find Aiwei, we'll find Zaheer."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "No! We're not hunting this group. There could be other secret agents in other parts of the world looking for you right now! I'm taking you back to Republic City, where I can protect you."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "If I wasn't safe here, then I'm not safe anywhere. I have to stop them!"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "It's too dangerous! You are not going!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Stop trying to protect me! I'm the Avatar. This is my job!"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Don't lecture me about jobs!"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Enough! Korra, listen to Lin."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "But ... they ..."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Please. Lin's only looking out for you. I promise you, Aiwei and everyone he's working with will be brought to justice."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Fine, if you really think it's best."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "I do."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Thank you, Su."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Everyone should get some rest tonight.

There's a jeep packed with supplies on the east gate. It's all gassed up and ready to go."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What? Why?"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Because I want you to hunt down Aiwei and bring him back to me."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "But you said -"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "I said what Lin wanted to hear and I bought you guys some time.

I'm just waiting to hear if she'd tracked down Aiwei yet."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "What! You let Korra go?! I thought we were on the same page about this, and then you go and stab me in the back?"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Oh, don't be so overdramatic. You can't control the Avatar's every move."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "I can try."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Naga found something.  Oh ... Sorry, I forgot to bring treats  but, good girl."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "This must be Aiwei's jeep.

We should wear disguises and pretend we're going undercover! That way,  no one will recognize us. Haha, police work is so exciting!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "All right, now we need our undercover identities!  I'm an ex-United Forces operative named Ting-Ting. War was the only woman I ever loved, until Ivy came along and showed me what real love is. Tragically, she was taken from me by my archenemy Dr. Razor and -"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Enough!  Let's just find Aiwei."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "But I haven't even told your backstory."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I'm a cop.

My drinks are terrible."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Are you okay?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm just frustrated. What does Zaheer want with me?

This must be where and when Aiwei's going to meet Zaheer!"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "All right. Xai Bau's Grove, where are you?  Go away! I'm trying to find something."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Well, aren't you a cute little spir-  Ow! Hey!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "No luck here."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I think there might be a couple bounty hunters over there who recognize me!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "We've been made.

We should head back to Korra before someone else recognizes us."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "We could, or ... we could follow Aiwei instead.  Look!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "All right.  Stay cool and follow my lead."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Ting-Ting always finds his man."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Keep an eye on him. I'll go get Korra."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "We found Aiwei hiding in an inn."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "That's great!"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "We found something too.  It looks like he's gonna meet Zaheer at sundown at a place called Xai Bau's Grove. But I can't find it anywhere on the map."}, {"speaker": " Korra ", "text": "Let's go bust down Aiwei's door and finally get some answers."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "No. Once Aiwei knows we're onto him, we lose our advantage. I say we stake out his room and when he leaves for this meeting, we follow him."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "And he'll lead us straight to Zaheer."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Good afternoon. We'd like a room on the ground floor, across from 102, please."}, {"speaker": "Innkeeper", "text": "Forget it! Last time a bunch of teenagers came in here, they trashed the whole room."}, {"speaker": "Macao", "text": "We found you!"}, {"speaker": "Innkeeper", "text": "Hey, no bending in here! Take it outside!"}, {"speaker": "Macao", "text": "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not here to fight you.  We're here to meet Nuktuk!"}, {"speaker": "Lily", "text": "We're your biggest fans. Can you make it out to Lily and Macao?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Uh, I'd be happy to. Always love meeting my fans."}, {"speaker": "Lily", "text": "I made this Nuktuk doll for you."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Uh, it's ... cute."}, {"speaker": "Innkeeper", "text": "Why didn't you tell me your friend was a mover star? I'd be happy to rent you any room in the inn."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "We'll just take the one across from 102."}, {"speaker": "Innkeeper", "text": "But that room is too small for the four of you!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Trust me, it'll be perfect."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I'd just like to say, for the record, this room is definitely not perfect.  Naga!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "There he is."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I thought stakeouts were supposed to be exciting. This isn't. At all!  Ooh, I wonder if there's any snacks in here.  Hey, look! A Pai Sho board! Mako, you want to play?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Kind of busy here, bro."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "I'll play."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Oh, well, ugh, no offense but I learned street Pai Sho from Shady Shin, and I'm pretty good. So, wouldn't really be a fair game."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "So? I learned to play from my dad, the diabolical genius. I'll destroy you."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Well, looks we've got ourselves a Pai-Shodown.  Ladies first.  Uh, I don't mean to rush you, but let's speed things up a bit."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Why? This game is all about slow, methodical strategy."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "No, it's not. This is a fast-paced, edge of your seat, game of chance! Don't think. Just go."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "I don't know what Shady Shin taught you, but it wasn't the real Pai Sho."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Oh really? I think Mr. Rulebook might disagree with you.  The origins of Pai Sho date back over ten thousand years. It is a game of both strategy and chance. Wait, how can it be both?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Let me see that.  There have been countless variations of Pai Sho through the centuries and each culture has its own rules and variations of the game."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "That's no help at all. Korra, as the Avatar, you need to standardize these Pai Sho rules."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Okay, I'll put that on my to-do list, right after bringing back the Air Nation and taking down the group that tried to kidnap me."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "That's cool. Whenever you get to it."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Assuming we do find Zaheer, what then?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Then I make him talk."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "He was locked away for thirteen years, Korra, and never broke. I don't think a little bending is going to intimidate this guy."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You have a better idea?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Yeah, we spy on them. If Aiwei and Zaheer don't know they're being watched, they'll talk freely. Then we'll find out who they are and what they want."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "That's just like Pai Sho!  In order to defeat your opponent, you first have to know your opponent."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Then I guess I know you pretty well.  I win."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "What? Ugh. All right, you know what that was just a fluke. Best two out of three.  Oh, come on! Best four out of seven. Eight out of fifteen. Seventeen out of thirty-three?  Ha, ha! Looks like you're on the ropes this time."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "I can't believe it. You might actually win this one."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "No, Pabu?  Why?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "It's almost sundown. Why hasn't Aiwei left yet?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Maybe he sneaked out when you weren't looking."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "No, I just saw him peeking out of his window fifteen minutes ago. It's in my logbook."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm going over there."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Korra, wait! You're going to blow our element of surprise."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "It's over, Aiwei! Where's ...?  What?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "That's a weird way to nap."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "He's not sleeping. He's meditating. Wait! Asami, those spirits were trying to tell us something earlier. Xai Bau's Grove isn't on the map because it's not in the physical world! It's in the Spirit World! I'm going in after him."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "We'll watch him in case he wakes up. Be careful!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "What happened back in Zaofu? You told me we wouldn't have any problems getting the Avatar? Because of you, we've all been compromised."}, {"speaker": "Aiwei", "text": "No, any evidence was destroyed when my library burned."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Where is your physical body now?"}, {"speaker": "Aiwei", "text": "At the Misty Palms Inn. But there is no need to worry. I was not followed."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "You left a loose end."}, {"speaker": "Aiwei", "text": "I assure you, no one knows anything about us."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "No, you are the loose end."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Zaheer!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "It seems Aiwei was mistaken. He was followed."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "That's right. We knew he'd lead us straight to you. Now, what did you do with him?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "He'll be spending eternity in the Fog of Lost Souls, which just leaves the two of us."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Don't move, Zaheer. You're going to give me some answers."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "There's no need for aggression. Neither of us has our bending, and I'm not going anywhere. I'll answer whatever questions you have. You deserve that much.  What would you like to know?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "First off, who are you people, and why do you keep trying to take me?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "We are part of a secret society, dedicated to restoring freedom to the world. We are the Red Lotus."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Red Lotus? Are you related to the White Lotus?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "We are what the White Lotus was meant to be. But after the Hundred Year War, the White Lotus lost its true purpose. Its members came out of hiding and openly served the Avatar. They became nothing but glorified bodyguards who served corrupt nations. So a great man named Xai Bau broke from the White Lotus and began his own society."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "That's a great story, but it doesn't explain why you tried to take me when I was a kid."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "That was Unalaq's idea."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What? My uncle was part of the Red Lotus?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Avatar Korra. Misty Palms Inn. Find her."}, {"speaker": "P-Li", "text": "You two go. I'll stay here and make sure Zaheer's body is safe."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "I met your uncle when I was a teenager, after we had both joined the Red Lotus. We learned about Raava and Vaatu, and how Avatar Wan foolishly severed them, disrupting the balance of the world forever."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Avatar Wan wasn't foolish! He was trying to restore balance."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "He closed the portals, severing humans from spirits. Even you realize the error in his ways."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "So all along, you and my uncle planned to use me to open the portals and release Vaatu? That's why you tried to take me when I was a kid?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Yes, and with members of the Red Lotus as your elemental masters, we could've taught you so much."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "It sounds like you were just trying to brainwash me so I'd do whatever you wanted."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "No, Korra. All I wanted was to show the Avatar a better path for the world."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Uh, I don't know how, but Water Arm Lady and Lava Guy found us."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "How?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I just said I don't know how!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Korra, come on! Wake up!"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "What do we do?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Get Korra out of here. Bolin and I will hold them off."}, {"speaker": "Ming-Hua", "text": "The Avatar!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "If my uncle came up with a plan to abduct me when I was a kid, why wasn't he caught?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "He wasn't with us that night, and he covered up his involvement afterwards."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "So he betrayed you, just like he betrayed me."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Yes. He allowed me and my friends to remain in prison while he pursued his own selfish goals. Unalaq becoming a Dark Avatar was never part of our mission."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "And what is your mission, exactly?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "I want what you want: to restore balance to this world."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I don't think our ideas of balance are the same."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Are you sure about that? You kept the spirit portals open. But why stop there? Bringing the spirits back should only be the beginning."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What do you mean?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "The idea of having nations and governments is as foolish as keeping the human and spirit realms separate. You've had to deal with a moronic president and a tyrannical queen. Don't you think the world would be better off if leaders like them were eliminated?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No. I mean, I don't really agree with what they've done, but taking out world leaders isn't the answer."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "It wasn't too long ago that the airbenders were nearly all wiped out, thanks to the Fire Lord's desire for world dominance. True freedom can only be achieved when oppressive governments are torn down."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "But that won't bring balance. It will throw the world into chaos ."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Exactly. The natural order is disorder. Do you know who once said, \"New growth cannot exist without first the destruction of the old\"?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "The wise Guru Laghima. An airbender."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I can't beat this guy! It's like I'm giving him ammo! Want to trade?"}, {"speaker": "Ming-Hua", "text": "Go get the Avatar! I have these two under control."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "You know, being locked away for so many years, I was beginning to lose hope.  But when I awoke with airbending, I knew I would be the one to destroy the old world and plant seeds for a new world to flourish."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Zaheer, please, as an airbender, you could help make a positive difference in the world, instead of destroying it."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "You're a very smart young woman, Korra. But you must realize that once change begins, it cannot be stopped, even by the Avatar."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Enough with your philosophical mumbo-jumbo! I want to know one thing. If you do capture me, what are you going to do with me?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "You'll have that answer soon enough. The Red Lotus should have you by now. See you in the physical world."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Zaheer!  Zaheer, you tricked me! Let me go!  Asami, are you okay? Where's the rest of the Red Lotus?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "What's the Red Lotus? And Zaheer didn't capture us, the Earth Queen's forces did."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Where are we?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "I'm not sure. Some camp by the desert. They're taking us back to Ba Sing Se."}, {"speaker": "Ghazan", "text": "The Earth Queen's army snatched up the Avatar before I could."}, {"speaker": "Ming-Hua", "text": "But we figured you could find a use for these two."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Load them in the truck.

Red Lotus is the world's newest threat. After confronting Zaheer, Korra learned that he is part of a secret society whose mission is to take out all the nations' leaders and destroy world order. But before Korra could warn anyone, she and Asami were apprehended by the Earth Queen's forces. And the Red Lotus have Mako and Bolin. Now both parties are headed toward Ba Sing Se."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You have to let me out! The Earth Queen is in danger from a group of terrorists calling themselves the Red Lotus.  I talked to one of them in the Spirit World yesterday. He's insane!"}, {"speaker": "Captain", "text": "Screaming about terrorists in the Spirit World? You're the one who sounds insane."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Do I have to be chained to the floor the whole way? It's going to be so uncomfortable."}, {"speaker": "Arik", "text": "Sorry Ma'am, I'm under orders."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Can't you just chain me to that railing?  I mean, where am I gonna go?  Please?"}, {"speaker": "Arik", "text": "Well, as long as you're chained up, I guess it doesn't make a difference."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Thank you, Sir."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Can I have ... some water?"}, {"speaker": "Arik", "text": "No water. We're also not going to bring you any rocks or fire, so don't ask. I guess there's air, but there's nothing we can do about that. We're not opening your compartment 'til we reach Ba Sing Se."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I hoped Mako or Bolin would have shown up to save us by now. I wonder if they're okay."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "If you think  holding us hostage will give you some leverage against the Avatar, you're gonna be very disappointed."}, {"speaker": "Ming-Hua", "text": "Can't we just enjoy our time together in silence ?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "And why did you need Korra alive back in Zaofu? You had her paralyzed. Why didn't you just take her out when you had the chance?"}, {"speaker": "Ghazan", "text": "Look, all you need to know is that the world is about to change, for the better."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "So you guys were like locked up for fifteen years, huh ? It must've been like crazy boring."}, {"speaker": "Ghazan", "text": "Actually, it was only thirteen years. But it felt like thirty."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I mean, what did you do with all that time? Did you sing songs, work on crafts?"}, {"speaker": "Ming-Hua", "text": "Not a lot of craft supplies in a volcanic prison cell."}, {"speaker": "Ghazan", "text": "And I must've renamed the constellations about a thousand times. When it rained, that was a big event."}, {"speaker": "Ming-Hua", "text": "I would've killed for some rain. Mostly I just made up stories about the guards: who was having trouble with his girlfriend; which one secretly wished he'd become a pastry chef."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Ooh okay, that sounds like fun. Let me try that on you guys.  You were raised by an older sister, your mustache grew in when you were ten and I'm sensing - just sensing - an unspoken attraction between you two."}, {"speaker": "Ghazan", "text": "Two out of three. Not bad."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Bolin, would you stop making friends with the bad guys?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Sorry!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Ghazan, gag those two. We're almost there."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "We have to find a way to get out of this prison before we get to the Earth Queen."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Don't worry, I have a plan. These airships the Cabbage Corp sold to the Earth Kingdom are way cheaper than the ones Future Industries built."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Now that's just shoddy workmanship.  There's no way I can get these locks off. I need the keys.  Give me five minutes, then start yelling for help."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "When is the Avatar scheduled for delivery?"}, {"speaker": "Gun", "text": "The airship already left Fort Bosco and should be arriving in a few hours."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "Excellent. Bring it to me as soon as it lands."}, {"speaker": "Gun", "text": "Yes, Your Majesty. But first there are some ... people here who captured two of the Avatar's friends. They would like to present them to you personally."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "You know I don't meet with bounty hunters."}, {"speaker": "Gun", "text": "And of course I told them that. But they say they have some information that might interest you; about the location of your stolen airbenders."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "Really?  Fine, send them in.  Ah, yes, I remember these two. We'll find an acceptable home for you in prison , with the rest of the dissidents.  Now, I'm told you have some information for me. I hope this isn't just some ruse to increase your bounty."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "We don't want any bounty, Your Majesty. You can consider these two a \"thank you\" gift for simply taking the time to talk to us."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "How very magnanimous. So, where are my airbenders?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "I'd be happy to tell you, once you hand the Avatar over to me."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "Who told you that we have the Avatar?!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "How I know is not important. But if I found out, others will too. And that could put you in a difficult position."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "Is that so?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Your Majesty, imprisoning the Avatar will cause the other nations to turn against you and demand her freedom. Before long, we'd be in the midst of a sticky international incident. If you let me take her today, no one need ever know she was here, and you can get your airbenders back without interference. We both win."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "And what do you plan to do with the Avatar should I see fit to grant your request."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "All I can say is: I have business with her. But she won't be bothering you again. I can assure you of that."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "I find these terms agreeable. Gun, escort them to the antechamber until the Avatar's arrival.  Send these two to the dungeon."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Guards!  Get in here!  Something happened to my friend. She needs help."}, {"speaker": "Arik", "text": "Where is she?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Nice work. Now let's take control of the ship."}, {"speaker": "Captain", "text": "Mayday! Mayday! The Avatar has escaped. We're going down in quadrant four of the Si Wong Desert."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "I think you might have been a little over-aggressive with the airbending. The controls are busted.  Also, you broke the radio."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Sorry, but it's not my fault this airship's a hunk of junk."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Hang on to something!"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Well. They say any landing you could walk away from is a good landing.  But, given our location, I'm not so sure about that."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You're the engineer. What do you think? Can we get flying again?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "It doesn't look good. Even if you metalbend the propellers back into shape, we have to dig this whole thing out of the sand."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Is everyone all right?"}, {"speaker": "Arik", "text": "Like you care."}, {"speaker": "Kong", "text": "What the heck happened?"}, {"speaker": "Arik", "text": "She said her friend needed help, then they knocked me out!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm sorry. But I couldn't let you take me to the Earth Queen as a captive. There are dangerous forces at work that you don't know anything about."}, {"speaker": "Kong", "text": "More dangerous than being stranded in the desert?"}, {"speaker": "Captain", "text": "Don't worry, Kong. I've radioed Ba Sing Se before we went down. We just need to sit tight. Somebody will be here to rescue us."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm not waiting around for that. We need to get out of here now ."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "If we all work together, we might be able to get the ship up and running."}, {"speaker": "Kong", "text": "Not likely. I just tunneled out the engine room. It's like a sandbox in there."}, {"speaker": "Captain", "text": "This ship isn't going anywhere. And neither are you. You're prisoners and it's our duty to transport you to the Earth Queen."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You realize that I'm the Avatar, right?  You don't want to fight me."}, {"speaker": "Captain", "text": "I'm afraid you aren't giving us much of a choice. We have our orders."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Wait, did that sand dune just move?"}, {"speaker": "Captain", "text": "It was probably just a mirage. The desert will play tricks on you."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "That's no mirage. Look."}, {"speaker": "Kong", "text": "I heard that since all the spirits came back, this desert has been haunted by them."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Oh right, so I guess that's my fault too. Do you want to help us get this ship up and running, or do you want to wait around and meet that thing?"}, {"speaker": "Kong", "text": "We want to fix the ship. Right, Cap?"}, {"speaker": "Captain", "text": "Let's get to work."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Everybody stand back."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "We have to find a way out of here before Zaheer gets his hands on Korra."}, {"speaker": "Prisoner", "text": "Take me with you. I haven't seen my wife and five kids for four years."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Four years?"}, {"speaker": "Prisoner", "text": "The first few months were great, I-I could finally get some sleep, but ...  now I really miss them."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Listen. Bolin, this is up to you. I know you can metalbend."}, {"speaker": "Prisoner", "text": "You can metalbend?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "No."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Yes you can. I believe in you."}, {"speaker": "Prisoner", "text": "I believe in you too, Bolin."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I appreciate that, Mako, and fellow ... prisoner man. But I've been trying and trying and trying and I've never been able to do it. Not even a little."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "You've always had the ability deep down. You just haven't had the motivation. But this is your time! Get us out of here to save Korra. You can do it!  Bolin! Bolin!"}, {"speaker": "Other prisoners", "text": "Bolin! Bolin! Bolin! Bolin!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "You're right.  Okay, here I go. Metalbending.  I can't metalbend."}, {"speaker": "Other prisoners", "text": "Aww!"}, {"speaker": "Prisoner", "text": "Hey, you guys didn't happen to bring any toilet paper, do you?"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "First, you scare the life out of me, now you want to lick me."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Here, chew on this  and leave me alone.  Tonraq, you read me?"}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "Yes, we copy."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "I've found Korra's jeep, but the kids aren't here. Meet me at the Misty Palms Oasis."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "How's it looking in there?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I just airbent all the sand out of the engine room. I think it's clean."}, {"speaker": "Kong", "text": "Hasn't been this clean since it floated off the showroom floor."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "How's it going out here?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Well, she's still pretty banged up, but I think she might be able to limp out of the desert. Kong, you want to see if you can get the engine started?"}, {"speaker": "Kong", "text": "Aye aye!"}, {"speaker": "Arik", "text": "All right!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "That's no spirit!  I think it's gone now."}, {"speaker": "Arik", "text": "Kong, are you all right? What are we going to do? All of our supplies were on the ship. We've got no food, no water."}, {"speaker": "Captain", "text": "Easy, Arik. Another ship is on the way. We just need to hold our position for a few hours."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "We might not have a few hours."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "How far are we from the edge of the desert?"}, {"speaker": "Captain", "text": "Too far to walk, if that's what you're thinking."}, {"speaker": "Arik", "text": "We can't just wait around to for that thing to pick us off one by one !"}, {"speaker": "Captain", "text": "You'll do as you're told, Airman. Now get a hold of yourself!"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Maybe we can still build something to get us all out of here."}, {"speaker": "Captain", "text": "You want to make some wings out of scrap metal and flap real hard?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "No, but we might have enough material to construct a makeshift sand-sailer. Like the sandbenders use to get around. All we need is a sail and some kind of sled to attach it to."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "It's worth a try."}, {"speaker": "Captain", "text": "Gather every piece of metal you can find. We'll give that sandy beast a run for his money yet."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Looks like he's in hurry. Wait here."}, {"speaker": "Dai Li agent", "text": "Your Majesty, we received a distress signal from the airship carrying the prisoners. We believed the ship crashed in the Si Wong desert and the Avatar may have escaped."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "This is outrageous! Send another airship to retrieve the Avatar immediately."}, {"speaker": "Dai Li agent", "text": "It's already on its way, Your Majesty."}, {"speaker": "Ming-Hua", "text": "What are we going to do now?"}, {"speaker": "Ghazan", "text": "There's no way we can track her down in the desert before the queen gets to her."}, {"speaker": "P'Li", "text": "You really think we'd be lucky enough to capture her again? She'll be long gone by the time they arrive."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "It doesn't matter. We're through chasing her. It's time to make her come to us."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "What is this riff-raff doing in my throne room unannounced?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Apologies, Your Majesty. But I couldn't help overhearing that the Avatar won't be joining us today."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "The Avatar is still in my custody. However, eavesdropping on royal conversations will land you in a cell right next to those boys you brought in. Now, if you value your freedom, you'll tell me where the airbenders are right now!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "That wasn't the deal."}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "I will not bandy words with bounty hunters!  Seize these hoodlums and throw them in prison until they decide to show proper respect for the crown!"}, {"speaker": "Hou-Ting", "text": "Gun! Get in back here and lay down your life for your queen, you coward !  You wouldn't dare attack a queen!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Maybe I forgot to mention something to you. I don't believe in queens.  You think freedom is something that you can give or take on a whim ...  To your people ... freedom is just as essential as ... air. And without it ... there is no life.  There is only ... darkness."}, {"speaker": "Radio operator", "text": "Hey! You can't be in here!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "No need for alarm. I just need to make an announcement to the entire city. How do I do that?"}, {"speaker": "Radio operator", "text": "Who do you think you are?"}, {"speaker": "Ming-Hua", "text": "He's the man who just took down the Earth Queen. You want to be next?!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Ming-Hua, please. We're here to help citizens like him, not hurt them.  Now, can you help me?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Attention citizens of Ba Sing Se. I have an important announcement to make.  Moments ago, the Earth Queen was brought down by the hands of revolutionaries,  including myself. I'm not going to tell you my name, because my identity is not important.  I'm not here to take over the Earth Kingdom. I think you've had enough of leaders telling you what to do. It's time for you to find your own path. No longer will you be oppressed by tyrants.

Of course, there would be no Air Nation without Avatar Korra: she opened the portals and somehow the world began anew for us. And she was even willing to lay down her own life in order to protect ours. There's no way we can ever repay her for all she's done. But we can follow her example of service and sacrifice. So while she recuperates, the Air Nation will reclaim its nomadic roots and roam the earth.  But unlike our ancestors, we will serve people of all nations, working wherever there is corruption and discord to restore balance and peace. Avatar Korra, I vow that we will do everything in our power to follow in your footsteps and bring harmony to the world.

dreams and Spirit Wilds!  This metropolis truly has something for everyone. Visit Air Temple Island, the hub for all airbenders as they travel the world, helping others. Or take a stroll through beautiful Avatar Korra Park, named in honor of \"You-Know-Who\"! We've missed her these past three years and we can't wait to welcome her home. Get well soon, Korra! And of course, you'll want to see our most unique attractions: the Spirit Wilds. Here, spirits and people live harmoniously together.  Like this old codger, and his new pals. Yes siree, this town is truly on the up and up! Come be a part of the action in Republic City!"}, {"speaker": "Raiko", "text": "And of course, my biggest thanks goes to Asami Sato and Future Industries. She brought our old central terminal into the modern era. Ladies and gentlemen, the world is entering a new age of peace and prosperity. Soon, Prince Wu will take his rightful place on the Earth Kingdom throne.  And thanks to our updated rail system, Republic City and the Earth Kingdom will be united like never before!"}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Hey there! Asami, right? Great train house. Maybe you can give me a personal tour sometime, what do you say?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "I do like the idea of putting you on a train and sending you far, far away."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "That's ... that's funny. I like funny dames. Maybe I should introduce myself. I'm Prince Wu, future king."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Yeah ... I'm aware of who you are."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Don't let my reputation intimidate you. I'm still human just like everyone else. Only more human, like, extra human, or, hmm, superhuman ."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Superhuman?"}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "So, what do you say? Can I show you a low-key night out with a superhuman soon-to-be king?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Prince Wu! President Raiko has some really important ... king stuff to talk to you about."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Now?  Fine.  Think over the offer.  I'll be back."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "He's a real charmer, huh?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "He's ... something. How can you stand being his bodyguard?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Well, I just remind myself that once he's on the throne, I go back to being a detective."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "And that works?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I also go home, and smash my head into the wall for an hour, you know, just to get the stress out."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "It's good to see you, Mako. It's been too long. You hear from Bolin lately?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I haven't talked to him for a while, but he's coming in a few days for the coronation. And Beifong told me that Korra is getting in tonight."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "I can't wait to see her.  It's going to be weird, having the old Team Avatar back in the city after all these years."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "After your coronation, the United Forces will escort you to Ba Sing Se."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Right. About that. Are we all positive that the Earth Kingdom is safe enough for me to return? I don't have to remind everyone what happened to my great-aunt three years ago?!  May she rest in peace."}, {"speaker": "Raiko", "text": "Prince Wu, I assure you, Kuvira has the Earth Kingdom pretty much stabilized at this point."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Uh ... define \"pretty much\"."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Well, the roving bandits have mostly been dispersed."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Mostly?"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Don't worry kid.

The airbenders are here."}, {"speaker": "Governor", "text": "You finally made it! So where are the rest of you?"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Actually, it's just the two of us, but we're going to do everything we can to help. I'm Opal, and this is Kai."}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "It's nice to meet you."}, {"speaker": "Governor", "text": "What? I called Master Tenzin because my state has been under siege by bandits for months. They blocked all the roads, cut off our supply lines, and all he sent is you two kids?"}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "Hey, us two kids just took care of those three guys for you."}, {"speaker": "Governor", "text": "There are hundreds more where they came from. My citizens are going hungry. Our entire state is on the brink of collapse."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Unfortunately, the Air Nation is spread thin right now. We're all you have."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "We just got some good news.  Two more Earth Kingdom states have agreed to join us."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Excellent! Thank you, Bolin.  We're ninety percent there, Kuvira."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "That's great! Zhu Li, dish out some of that special celebration tea!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "None for me. I won't celebrate until the Earth Kingdom is one hundred percent reunited."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Why have we stopped?"}, {"speaker": "Driver", "text": "Apologies. There are rocks on the tracks. It's most likely bandits. We're sending troops to handle the situation."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Call them off. I will take care of the bandits myself ."}, {"speaker": "Female bandit #1", "text": "You're ... Kuvira."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "And you're the bandits who have been causing chaos where I'm trying to establish order, aren't you?"}, {"speaker": "Female bandit #1", "text": "We're sorry, we didn't know this was your train and ..."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Don't talk over me!"}, {"speaker": "Male bandit #1", "text": "Please, take mercy on us!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Stop groveling as if this is the worst day of your life. This ... is a good day. I'm going to give you all the opportunity to rehabilitate yourselves, and become productive members of your nation. Right now, you're lost, but pledge your loyalty to me, and I'll give you a new purpose in your lives. Of course, if you don't want to join, you could always stay right here. Hopefully, someone saves you before the next train speeds through, but I wouldn't count on it."}, {"speaker": "Male bandit #1", "text": "No, we'll join. Don't leave us here."}, {"speaker": "Female bandit #1", "text": "We pledge our loyalty to you, Great Uniter."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I don't know why we're leaving so early if you're just getting a haircut. The dinner at Air Temple Island isn't until later tonight."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Because I'm not just getting a haircut, it's a spa day! We're talking minimum four hours."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Are you kidding me?  What are you having done that takes four hours?"}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "A rejuvenating tea-leaf skin wrap. Have you ever gotten one of those, Mako?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Yeah, I'm ... not interested."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "You will be.  So while your hands soak in a bubbling milk-bath, your feet are in a tub full of these little sucker-fish that literally eat your calluses away. Gobble them right up! Crazy, huh?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "That's disgusting !"}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Then, they scrape your skin with blocks of sea-salt and lube you up with seaweed-infused aloe, wrap you in tea leaves, put you in a hot box for four hours, and bam ! You're done!  Mako, look at all my fans! They must be in town for my coronation."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I don't know if all those people are your fans."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Wu, we have to get you out of here!  Go! Go!"}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "What just happened out there?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I think those were Kuvira's supporters in the crowd."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Oh no! Mako, I've been hit! It's a gusher !"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "That's not blood. It's strawberry pie."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Oh. Yeah, you're right.  But that was close. I don't know what would have happened if you weren't there."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "You would have been hit by a pie. It's really not that big of a deal."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Or I could have been killed! I don't know what I'd ever do without you! Wait a second. Did you say strawberry pie?  I'm allergic to strawberries!  I don't think I can breathe! Get me to the hospital! Wu down!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "You're allergic to bee stings!"}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Oh. Yeah, you're right.  I always get those two mixed up."}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "Look! A train made it through!"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Maybe they brought food and supplies!"}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "Hey, what's your boyfriend doing here?"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "If he's here, he must be with Kuvira and my brother. This isn't going to be good."}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "Bolin!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Kai!  Wow , you are a lot heavier than you used to be. You're really growing up."}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "What's up with your new hair? You look like a stiff."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Hey, Kuvira says it makes me look intelligent and professional."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Don't believe everything she says."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Opal, I can't believe you're here too!  I missed you so much."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "I missed you too."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Look who it is. It's good to see you again, little sister."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "What a wonderful surprise. A happy reunion for my favorite couple."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "How's Mom doing?"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Like you care. She still hasn't forgiven you."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "You know, for someone who claims to be so enlightened, Mom can really hold a grudge."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "I guess when her son betrays her ..."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Please, Opal, we're not here to bicker with you about something that happened three years ago. We're here to help this town, just like you."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "I've heard how you help towns. By conquering them."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "I know the rumors about me can be pretty nasty, but I am giving everyone in this nation a better future. And with Bolin's help, and my fianc\u00e9's ideas, we're laying the ground work for the people to achieve their own greatness."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Your fianc\u00e9?"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "You haven't heard?  Your brother and I are getting married."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Isn't that great, sweetie?"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "I know things got heated with your family when Baatar and I left Zaofu, but don't you think it's time to forgive and forget?"}, {"speaker": "", "text": "What are you doing here?"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Hello, governor. I was wondering if you and I could talk privately."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "So, have you had time to rethink my generous offer?"}, {"speaker": "Governor", "text": "Generous ? You want to take everything. How is that generous?"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Governor, your state has been overrun by bandits. They have you outnumbered and outsupplied. The question's not if they'll take over; it's when . Unless you sign our deal. Agree to the terms, and you'll have the full force of my army backing you. You will remain in charge, just under my supervision. I will save your life, and the lives of your citizens. I think that's pretty generous."}, {"speaker": "Governor", "text": "I know how you manipulate states, and force them to join up under you. I know the only reason you want this region is because it is rich in ore.  They might call you \"The Great Uniter\", but you're destroying everything! I'll never turn the great state of Yi over to you!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "You have a lot of pride, but it cannot protect your people.  Your pride will not stop the hordes as your city crumbles to the ground. And your pride will certainly not feed your hungry when all that is left is rubble!"}, {"speaker": "Governor", "text": "Leave! Get out of my state!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "You will perish, unless you take my generous offer."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "It's time to go. We're not wanted here."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "What happened?"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "It appears we can't make a deal right now."}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "Wait! Aren't you guys going to stick around and help?"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Here's the contract. We'll wait at the border for one day. You get the governor to sign it, and you'll have all the help you need."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I guess ... I got to go."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Don't! Please, you can't turn your back on these people!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I'm not! I wanna help, but if the Governor wants us gone, there's ... there's nothing I can do. I'm sorry.  Hey ... Opal, please."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Leave, if that's what you're going to do."}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "You know, we might not need their help after all. The roads may be impassable, but not the skies. We can use Lefty to fly to all the nearby villages, pick up supplies, and fly back."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "You're right. We can save this town ourselves."}, {"speaker": "Farmer", "text": "Sorry we couldn't give you more. That's all we could spare."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Every little bit helps. Because of you and the other farmers around here, we have more than enough food to feed the town until we can get some reinforcements."}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "Thanks!"}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "So ... you and Bolin doing okay?"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "I don't know. It's really tough having a long distance relationship. And I can't stand that he's working with Kuvira."}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "I can tell. But it does seem like he found his calling, doesn't it? He loves helping people."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Maybe. It's just ... he's changed a lot since he's been around her."}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "He's growing up."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "I just hope we're not growing apart.  Speaking of long-distance relationships, how are you and Jinora doing?"}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "Actually, we're doing fine.  You hear that?"}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "It's more bandits!"}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "We're hooked!"}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "No!"}, {"speaker": "Governor", "text": "What happened? Where's all the food?"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "We were attacked in mid-air. We lost everything."}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "It might be time to make a tough call."}, {"speaker": "Governor", "text": "Here. Tell Kuvira to save my people."}, {"speaker": "Kai", "text": "For what it's worth, I think you made the right decision."}, {"speaker": "Governor", "text": "Did I ever really have a choice?"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "When Korra gets here, I bet she's not even going to know who I am."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Why is that?"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Because Meelo the boy  has turned into Meelo the man !"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Right. You're completely unrecognizable."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "You've never had the tea leaf wrap? You have no idea what you're missing. The face massage alone is to die for."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Ugh. This coronation cannot come soon enough. I can't wait to go back to being a detective."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Right ... umm ... yeah, about that ..."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "What?"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "I don't know how to tell you this ... you're going to Ba Sing Se ... with the prince."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "No!"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "I tried to get you out of it, but it's over my head.  Wu personally asked Raiko. He says he doesn't know what he'd do without you."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "This can't be happening! I'm not even an Earth Kingdom citizen; I work for the Republic City Police Department."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Not anymore.  You're just a pawn in Raiko's diplomatic game. You can try talking to him, but I don't think he's going to let you quit."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": ""}, {"speaker": "Acolyte", "text": "There's a Southern Water Tribe ship pulling up to the dock!"}, {"speaker": "Children", "text": "Korra!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "The State of Yi is now under the full protection of my army.

I'm gonna write so many letters and, just to get the ball rolling, here.  Spoiler alert: Pabu and I already miss you."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Thanks. That's sweet."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Are you sure you don't want some company in the Southern Water Tribe? I'm happy to come with you."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No ... I appreciate it, but I'll only be gone a couple of weeks.  A little time alone will be good for me."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Now, I don't want you to worry about a thing while you're gone. Your recovery should be your number one concern.

It worked!"}, {"speaker": "Katara", "text": "The mind can be a powerful ally,  or your greatest enemy.  Now, I want you to try  taking a step."}, {"speaker": "Katara", "text": "You're okay.

Try again."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm done for today."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Dear Korra. I miss you. It's not the same in Republic City without you. How are you feeling?  Things are going well here. I just got a big contract to help redesign the city's infrastructure, so I'll be keeping pretty busy for a while."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Hey, Korra! Sooo, I'm not very good at writing letters. It's 2:15 in the afternoon. Weather is fair. Chance of snow showers later today. But enough joking around.  I hope you're dong well. Me?

A crazy man poisoned me and now I can't dress myself, or cook for myself, o-or do anything for myself!

I'm so tired."}, {"speaker": "Katara", "text": "Korra, I know you feel alone right now. But you're not the first Avatar who's had to overcome great suffering.  Can you imagine how much pain Aang felt when he learned that his entire culture was taken from him?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "That ... must have been so awful."}, {"speaker": "Katara", "text": "But he never let it destroy his spirit.

You look great!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I feel great!  Come on, I want to show you how much better I'm doing."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Attack! I can take it!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "All right! The sparring match is over!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I thought I was ready."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "There is no shame in taking the time you need to make a full recovery.

I was going to say, you need to ... not worry about the future. Be grateful for where you are now and the progress you've made."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Dear Asami, I'm sorry I haven't written to you sooner, but every time I've tried, I never know what to say.  The past two years have been the hardest of my life. Even though I can get around fine now, I still can't go into the Avatar State. I keep having visions of Zaheer and what happened that day.  Katara thinks a lot of this is in my head, so I've been meditating a lot, but sometimes I worry I'll never fully recover.  Please don't tell Mako and Bolin I wrote to you and not them. I don't want to hurt their feelings, but it's easier to tell you about this stuff.  I don't think they'd understand."}, {"speaker": "Senna", "text": "Everything all right, sweetie?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "There's something I need to tell you both."}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "What is it?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I want to go back to Republic City."}, {"speaker": "Senna", "text": "Are you sure?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I know I'm not a hundred percent yet, but I feel like I've hit a wall. I need to be where the action is,  where my friends are."}, {"speaker": "Tonraq", "text": "I'll have the White Lotus prepare a boat and they can take you back to Republic City as soon as you're ready."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No, I want to go alone and have some time to clear my head.

Mind if I took a picture for my \"Wall of Avatars\"?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Well, uhm, I'm kind of in a hurry."}, {"speaker": "Fishmonger", "text": "I-it'll only take a second!  Avatar Aang was a big fan of my seaweed wraps, you know, so,  I named 'em \"Aang Rolls\"!  Now they're my biggest seller! And they ain't even got fish in 'em!  Now, smile!"}, {"speaker": "Fishmonger", "text": "But if I coulda met any Avatar,  I'd have to pick Kyoshi. Taking down a shark squid with one hand! Now that's a lady I'd like to get to know!"}, {"speaker": "Vendor", "text": "Thieves! Get back here!"}, {"speaker": "Fishmonger", "text": "Oh, don't worry, the Avatar's right here!  Well, what are you waiting for?  Go get 'em!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Hand over the bags or else."}, {"speaker": "Vendor", "text": "You sure she's the Avatar?"}, {"speaker": "Light spirit", "text": "Everyone, come here! It's the Avatar!"}, {"speaker": "Skeptical spirit", "text": "You sure? I don't sense any Raava energy around her. Besides, she's not dressed like the Avatar. And, doesn't the Avatar have ponytails?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Do you mind? I'm trying to concentrate here. And yes , I am the Avatar. I'm just wearing different clothes and I cut my hair."}, {"speaker": "Light spirit", "text": "See? I told you guys it was her!  How come you've been away so long?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I was hurt pretty bad a while ago and lost touch with my Avatar Spirit."}, {"speaker": "Skeptical spirit", "text": "No wonder I couldn't feel Raava's energy."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I came to the Tree of Time hoping to reconnect with Raava and turn on the Avatar State again. But it's not working.  The last time I was here, I saw all sorts of visions.  Now I don't see anything."}, {"speaker": "Light spirit", "text": "Maybe we can help you get better."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm sorry, but for years, people have been saying they can help me get better.  Nothing's worked.  I need to figure this out on my own."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Dear Mom and Dad,  I arrived in Republic City a couple weeks ago and couldn't be happier. It's nice to be back at the temple and it's great to see my friends again.  Don't worry, I'm taking it easy, but hopefully I'll be back in action soon. I miss you both very much. Please, give Naga a big hug for me. Love, Korra.  Raava?  Raava!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I am ending this."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Excuse me. Who do I talk to about getting in the ring?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Is that all you got?"}, {"speaker": "Ring announcer", "text": "We have a winner!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Why did you bring me to the swamp?

You should have told me who you were."}, {"speaker": "Light spirit", "text": "If I did, would you have followed me?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I get your point. But why did you bring me here?

Will this earthbending master be the key to Korra regaining her Avatar mojo?"}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "So then the crowds are gathered, all excited to see my coronation, when all of a sudden, these boulders come rolling through. And guess what pops out of 'em? Earthbender dames! These gals start banging the boulders like drums, and sing the song of my royal lineage.

They love a ceremony. Have you received any word on the Avatar's location?"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Not yet, but I have airbenders all over the world on the lookout for her.  I hope they find her soon. I'm concerned about reports I've heard regarding Kuvira's growing military.

If there's one thing I learned on the beat, it's that the names change, but the street stays the same."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "So, basically, you're saying that everything I've ever accomplished has been pointless.

Same thing."}, {"speaker": "Cam", "text": "I'm afraid there's been a mistake, Your Eminence.

My little brother got all ... important ."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I know, right? I see myself in the mirror sometimes and I think I'm in trouble before I realize: it's only me."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "So, what's it like working for Kuvira?  From what I've heard, she's pretty harsh."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "No! I\u2014I mean, she can be tough, sure, but we're turning around the Earth Kingdom like you wouldn't believe ! You remember how bad Grandma's neighborhood in Ba Sing Se was? All that's completely changed, I mean, we are really ... helping people. But what have you been up to? Fighting crime?  Busting triads? Chasing the ladies,  Mako-style ?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Well, I've been working for Wu.  And, uhhh ...  Yeah."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "So, have you seen Korra yet?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "No. She was supposed to come in with Tonraq, but he said she left the South Pole months ago.

I'll put in a good word for you with the hotel staff, maybe get you a little upgrade. I've been living here for years, they love me."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "I won't be needing your help. We've reserved the presidential suite."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Well, I think someone is pulling your chain, gumdrop!

Where are my grandfather's taffeta pantaloons?"}, {"speaker": "Gun", "text": "Sadly, most of your servants were scattered and the royal things were looted after the queen was  removed from office. So your coronation may not have some of the usual items ... like ... the crown."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "There's no crown?! How can you have a coronation without a crown?

You're blind compared to me."}, {"speaker": "Gun", "text": "Now rise, Wu of the Hou-Ting Dynasty, King of all the Earth Lands and glorious defender of Ba Sing Se. Long may you reign!"}, {"speaker": "Spectator #1", "text": "Go Wu! Woohoo ..."}, {"speaker": "Spectator #2", "text": "Woohoo ..."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Thank you, for that incredibly brief, but very moving ceremony. I am touched by the love of my devoted countrymen, who have worked so hard to restore their beloved leader to the throne. One of them deserves special attention.  Kuvira, rise!  For your service to the realm, I would like to present you with the Kyoshi Medal of Freedom, our nation's highest honor, which was somehow not stolen, unlike the royal pinky rings."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Thank you. And if you don't mind, I would like to say a few words."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Why not?  We've got six hours to fill ..."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Growing up in Zaofu, with Suyin Beifong,  I learned that the idea of a royal family passing a title from one generation to the next was archaic, and that technology and innovation should be what drives a nation forward. It was the pathetic rule of kings and queens that caused the Earth Kingdom to descend into such incredible disarray. It's taken me three years to get it back on track, and there is no way I will allow it to slip back into the dark ages.  I'd like to make an announcement to the world: the Earth Kingdom is no more. And from here on out,  this man has no authority."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Wait, what? But I just got the royal brooch!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "I have created a new Earth Empire , and I will continue to lead it into the future myself, bringing about a new era of prosperity for my people."}, {"speaker": "Crowd", "text": "We love you, Kuvira!

All hail the Great Uniter!"}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Worst coronation ever."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Were you surprised? Because I was really surprised. Won't this turn all the world leaders against us?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Relax, kid, what can they do? Kuvira controls the whole nation now, and Republic City is begging for the metal that we're mining. This train has left the station, and we own the track!"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Now that's a nice looking hunk of spirit vine! Let's take it back to the lab and get it stabilized immediately."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "You look worried, Bolin."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Yeah, well, I just have some misgivings about how you kind of ambushed Tenzin and the other leaders."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "You believe in the work that we've done for the people of the Earth Empire, right, Bolin?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I do, but ..."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Then stick with me. I'm going to need your help now more than ever. Raiko and the other leaders want to bully us into accepting some idiot king who will serve them but neglect the people. We have to stand strong against them."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I'm just not sure about this whole \"Empire\" thing. It seems pretty aggressive. And what was that part about the crushing?"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "That was just some ... tough rhetoric to let people know that we mean business. Believe me,  conflict is the last thing I want. Will you help me make history, Bolin?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I'll stand by you."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "We need to talk."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Can you give us the room, please?"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "I met with the world leaders, and I've come as their representative."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "So now you're taking an interest in world affairs. A little late, isn't it? When the queen fell, and everyone was asking you to help keep the Earth Kingdom from falling apart, all you wanted to do was hide in Zaofu, and let others deal with the consequences."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "That's hardly fair. I didn't want to seize power for myself, which is what you've done. I'm telling you for the good of everyone, you have to step down."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "I stepped up . I provide stability and equality. Tell your world leaders to stay out of Earth Empire business. We won't accept their hand-picked dictator."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "What makes you so different? You're just another tyrant. And don't pretend the people put you where you are. I know what happens to cities who don't want to hand over control to you."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Then you know what's coming for Zaofu."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "First I lose my suite, then I lose my throne.

I'll ... find a way to make it."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Good ol' Mako, my big tough guy.  Okay. I just have to go on, move forward, take decisive action.  Let's go shopping!"}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Ugh. Get rid of him. He's with her ."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "He's my brother."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Interesting ceremony, huh?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "You aren't going to keep working for Kuvira now that she's going against the wishes of the entire world, are you?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "You don't understand. Kuvira is helping out all the poor people of the Earth Empire. People like our family. This is for the best."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I don't know, bro."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Okay, why don't you come with me, and you'll see for yourself? We've done a lot of good, and Varrick is working on some new innovations. We're making history ."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "By \"crushing\" anyone who gets in your way?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "That was just some tough rhetoric to let the people know that we mean business. I mean, Kuvira is basically just like Korra.  She might seem hard to deal with, but just because she's so passionate and believes in what she's doing."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "It seems like she's just a dictator who's taking the Earth Kingdom by force."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Oh, okay, you think your new best friend in there  would be a better leader than Kuvira?"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Well, no, but still ..."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Still what?

What should I call you, other than \"beautiful\"?"}, {"speaker": "Tuyen", "text": "I'm Tuyen. Nice to meet you."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Ooh!  Meelo's got a girlfriend!"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Go away, Ikki!"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Jinora's been looking for you. We're moving on."}, {"speaker": "Tuyen", "text": "Looks like you got to get back to your mission.  Good luck."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Thanks a lot, Ikki. You drove away the love of my life ."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Jinora! Ikki! It's Korra!"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Where?! Where?! Where?!"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "It's just a photo of Korra."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "At least it's something."}, {"speaker": "Fishmonger", "text": "Pretty neat, huh? She came by here, about uh, six months ago."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Looks like someone just strummed up a good-old-fashioned lead.  Then where did she go?"}, {"speaker": "Fish monger", "text": "Oh, I don't know. But she wasn't looking too good."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Ikki, this is all your fault."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "What? I didn't do anything."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Exactly!  You need to start pulling your weight!  That goes for you too, so-called leader!"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Remember when he used to be so nice and sweet?"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "No."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "So ... what's the plan for today?"}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "You're looking at it."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "We didn't do anything yesterday, or the day before that.  I know! Tell me the story of how you taught Aang how to earthbend."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "What's there to tell? I threw some rocks at the Avatar, he got all whiny and Sokka fell in a hole."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I thought there'd be more to it than that.  What about the time you took down the Fire Lord? That must have been epic !"}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Oh yeah. It was hot. I was on a blimp. And I think a giant turtle showed up. Wow . What a day."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Okay, you're terrible at telling stories."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "You're terrible at listening to them!"}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Quit making all that racket! If you're so anxious to do something, why don't you collect some mushrooms for dinner?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You got it."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Take the path until you see the boulder with the hole in it. Then go to your left. Oh, and make sure you get the big, slimy ones!  They're the tastiest!"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Hey, where's all the food Mom gave us?"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "I threw it in the river."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "You did what ?! That food was supposed to last us two weeks !"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Hey, keep it down! I'm trying to meditate."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Yeah, keep it down, Ikki."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Meelo threw away all our food!"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "From now on, we hunt for our meals."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Meelo, we're vegetarians. We don't hunt!"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Enough whining. Poki and I will go find some grub."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "My name is Meelo. I like to throw away food and fart at inappropriate moments.  I'm Jinora. I'm above it all because I'm meditating all the time.  Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you there."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Wait! You dropped your breakfast!"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Hey!  Does this mean we're friends?"}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #1", "text": "You're trespassing! Hold it right there."}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #1", "text": "All right, little airbender. Tell us what you're doing in the Earth Empire. Are you spying?"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "No! I swear I'm not a spy. I've been traveling with my brother and sister. It's our first big mission and my dad, Tenzin, is counting on us. But if we don't find the Avatar, he's gonna be really disappointed."}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #1", "text": "Can I talk to you for a second?  This girl is Tenzin's kid and she's looking for the Avatar.  Do you know what that means?"}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #2", "text": "No, but try this macaroon!"}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #1", "text": "Get that out of my face! Look, if we capture these three airbender kids and bring them to Kuvira,  I bet we get a big-time promotion."}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #2", "text": "You mean we get out of this dump?"}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #1", "text": "Sorry, little lady, it looks like we got off on the wrong foot. So, you're out here with your brother and sister, where's your campsite?"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Why do you want to know?"}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #2", "text": "We just want to get the family back together again. Maybe we can sit everybody down and have a nice plate of macaroons."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Where did you get those?"}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #2", "text": "I found a whole sack of food down by the river! And with each delicious snack, comes a lovely hand-written note.  This one says: \"You're my handsome little man.\" That is so touching!"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "My mom wrote those notes! That's our sack of food!"}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #1", "text": "Enough with the cute notes! Where are your brother and sister?"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Who cares ... I don't want to see them . I'd rather hang out here with you guys. Hit me with one of those macaroons."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Are you okay?"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Yep, totally fine!  I hope you're hungry, because we found some ...  We found some berries!"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Looks like you got some bad berries.  So much for living off the land."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "They're fine, I just ate too many of them because they're so ... so delicious."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Did you run into Ikki while you were picking your poisonous berries?"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "No, what? Did she run off or something?"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "I think so."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Great. Now I've got to go find the Avatar and her. This mission is getting worse by the day."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "This isn't only your mission, Meelo. I thought we were doing this as a family."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "It seems pretty lonely out here. Where's everybody else?"}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #1", "text": "I ... don't want to talk about it."}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #2", "text": "He's just upset because Kuvira's taking all the troops to Zaofu and we had to stay here."}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #1", "text": "Well it's the last city left and then the whole empire will be united! And you know there's gonna be a huge party afterwards."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "It's tough to be left out, huh? I know exactly what you're going through."}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #1", "text": "You do?"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Yeah. My brother and sister are always leaving me out of fun stuff. I mean, we're supposed to be looking for the Avatar together , but they won't even let me help."}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #2", "text": "Well, that's not fair. Maybe we can help you out!  So, where have you looked for her?"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "We've been traveling down the west coast, and the only lead we have is some guy who said he saw her six months ago."}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #1", "text": "Well, we have troops ... pretty much everywhere. If anyone saw her, they would have reported it."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "What about this place?"}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #1", "text": "Well, that's the swamp. No one goes there."}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #2", "text": "Don't get discouraged, Ikki. You're a valuable member of the team, and you have a big heart! I know you're going to find her. Now let's get you out of those ropes."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "You're welcome, Ikki."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Why did you do that?"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "We're saving you. Let's go."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "I had everything under control. I just found our food, and I have an idea where Korra is."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "You do? Then lets get going!"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Hold on.  Sorry my brother and sister knocked you out. Nice chatting with you!"}, {"speaker": "Outpost soldier #2", "text": "Ugh ... Macaroon ..."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "There you are. You got my dinner yet?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No ... this swamp ... it did crazy things to my mind. I had visions, of all the times my enemies hurt me."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Yeah, I figured something like that might happen."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What ? You wanted me to see those visions? You are one twisted old lady, you know that?"}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Look, I know you want to get better. And so does the swamp! It can sense you're out of balance. It will teach you what you need to learn, if you're open to listening."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Okay, swamp. I'm all ears."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "You said you saw your past enemies. Now, why do you think that is?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I don't know. Because they made me and a lot of other people suffer."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Sounds like you're carrying around your former enemies, the same way you're still carrying around that metal poison. You maybe consider you could learn something from them?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Sounds like the swamp is messing with your mind too."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "My mind is just fine, thank you. Listen,  what did Amon want? Equality for all. Unalaq? He brought back the spirits. And Zaheer believed in freedom."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I guess ..."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "The problem was, those guys were totally out of balance and they took their ideologies too far."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Okay, fine. But that doesn't explain why they keep haunting me."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Because you need to face your fears. You can't expect to deal with future enemies if you're still fighting the old ones."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Maybe you're right, but how am I supposed to move on?"}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Boy, you Avatars sure need a lot of hand-holding. Get up! We're going to the banyan-grove tree."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Those soldiers said there weren't any troops here and, I figure, if Korra's not feeling good, she might come to a spiritual place like this to get better."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "There is an enormous amount of spiritual activity here, but I don't feel Korra."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Well, that's what we get for listening to Ikki ."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Guys! We just got here. Let's at least look around."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "I'm sorry, Ikki, but I'm with Meelo on this. I don't think we're going to find her here. Let's go Pepper!"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Why did those stupid vines pull us in here anyway?"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Because they want us here. I'm telling you, Korra has got to be close."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "I don't know, Ikki, I still don't sense Korra."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Well, you haven't sensed her the entire time we've been looking for her!"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Next time I go on a mission, it's going to be boys only. Just Poki and me."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "It's beautiful."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "The roots of the banyan-grove tree spread out for miles in every direction, connecting this whole swamp. Your problem is, you've been disconnected for too long. Disconnected from the people who love you and disconnected from yourself."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "I'm tired of listening to you!"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Korra! I know where Korra is!"}, {"speaker": "Meelo and Ikki", "text": "Yeah!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I can't believe it! I saw Jinora, Ikki and Meelo, they're here!"}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Good. Hopefully they're here to take you home."}, {"speaker": "Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo", "text": "Korra!"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "We missed you so much, Korra."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I missed you so much, too. How did you find me all the way out here?"}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Jinora sensed your energy."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "But we never would have been here if it weren't for Ikki."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "I never would have stormed off and run into those soldiers if it weren't for Meelo."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "I was trying to toughen up these ladies, but I guess it was a team effort."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "I love your hair."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "It's so you."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm so sorry. This is Meelo, Jinora, and Ikki. Aang and Katara's grandchildren."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Your grandpa was a real pain in my butt."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Wait a minute. Cranky? Old? Blind? You must be Toph !"}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Oh, I like this one."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "You need to come home, Korra. Kuvira is taking over the Earth Kingdom."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "You have to stop her."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I don't know ... I'm not the Avatar I used to be. I can't even go into the Avatar State."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Please, Korra."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "The world needs you back."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "All right. I'm ready."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "I'm not bending it out of you. You've got to do this on your own."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Close your eyes. Clear your mind. And don't freak out, like last time! Now, focus your energy. Find the metal. Let it move through you body."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "That fight is over. Release the fear."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Well done, Korra."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "The Avatar is back in business!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I feel so much lighter.

And the future is bright, let me tell you!  I've seen it! Yeah!  Saw it last month! We went to this town that had nothing. Most of the people there had never seen a Satomobile before. Now, they have two Satomobiles, running water, and a magnet train that goes right through their town! I mean, how awesome is that ?"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "They might have been happy when you first arrived, but I've seen what happens after you leave.

How many ... times have we used these \"other ways\" in the past?"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "It's not for you to worry about."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "So, uh ... what does happen to all those towns and villages after we leave? I just realized I'd never really ... gone back and ... checked on them."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Those people are my loyal subjects, and they contribute to the Empire however I see fit. Now that you're in the inner circle, you're going to have to accept some hard truths."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Maybe ... I'm not really an \"inner circle\" kind of guy. Or--or maybe, we don't take over Zaofu! Maybe we can just--let them be on their own, and then, \"Yay! The Empire's united! Congratulations to us!\""}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "I didn't know your personal feelings for Opal were stronger than your loyalty to me. Zaofu will join us. The only thing I'm second-guessing is my decision to bring you along.

I'm afraid I can't help you."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Suyin, I know this isn't my place, but I think you should do this. Zaofu has always been a beacon of modern progress, and now you can share that with everyone."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "What would you have me do? March into Ba Sing Se with an army? We'd be seen as conquerors and greeted with nothing but war."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "There are already wars. The Earth Queen nearly destroyed our nation. This is our opportunity to change things."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "It's not going to happen."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "I didn't realize it at the time, but that moment put a rift between us.

You will stay here!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "And who's going to stop me? Your security force was more than happy to join my cause.

After Kuvira proved herself by stabilizing Ba Sing Se,  Raiko and the other world leaders made her the provisional head of the Earth Kingdom. When she refused to step down, I knew it was only a matter of time before she made her way back here."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I want to fix this."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "You can. Go into the Avatar State and demolish her entire army. Remove Kuvira from power once and for all."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Fighting is something the old me would do.

Maybe I can reason with her."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Kuvira doesn't listen to reason."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "I can't believe Kuvira locked me in here like a prisoner !

Thank goodness you're here! Where did that hatch come from? Forget the hatch! There's something important I gotta tell ya!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Well, there's something important I gotta tell you, too!"}, {"speaker": "Varrick and Bolin", "text": "Kuvira's crazy!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "How'd you find out?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "When I refused to build her a superweapon, she threatened my life!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "She threatened me, too! And she's threatening Zaofu and it turns out, she's been threatening villages this whole time!  We gotta get outta here."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "I couldn't agree more, kid."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "We have an unexpected guest. The Avatar is here to see you."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Korra, it's such an honor to see you again. The last I heard, you were still healing in the South Pole."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Well, I'm feeling much better now."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "That's wonderful news."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm here to ask you to back down. Please. Take your army and leave."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "I think we both know that's not going to happen."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I can't let you take Zaofu."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Look, I was tasked with bringing stability to the Earth Kingdom. Zaofu is the last holdout. Why should I treat it differently than any other state?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "What you're doing isn't right!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "I understand you're just trying to do Su a favor, but you can't come to me as I am on the verge of reuniting my nation and tell me to stop. The world was descending into chaos while you were gone.  In order to fix it, I had to make some tough decisions."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I know what that's like. I've had plenty of people mad at me about decisions I've made."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Exactly. Korra, if you really want to help, go back to Su and try to talk some sense into her. Let's call a temporary truce. I won't make any moves until you talk to her and get back to me."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Maybe that will be for the best."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Have you seen Bolin?"}, {"speaker": "Guard #1", "text": "He came by to see Varrick, but we turned him away."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Open the door."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "We have some fugitives to catch."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Okay, I say we go up and around the mountains--  --and sneak into Zaofu from the rear."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "We're not going to Zaofu, that place is doomed ! We gotta head to Republic City!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "What? No, nonono, we gotta help here ."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "We'll be helping by warning the world about Kuvira's potential superweapon!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Well, that's helping, but it's a completely different type of helping.  Hmm . Let me think about this."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "That's not the flamethrower! What idiot designed these things?"}, {"speaker": "Zhu Li", "text": "You did, sir!"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Less lecturing, more saving my life!"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Hey! I think I figured it out!"}, {"speaker": "Zhu Li", "text": "Sir, you're making this very difficult."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Stop! Turn yourself over, or else ..."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Thanks a lot , Zhu Li."}, {"speaker": "Hiroshi", "text": "You came back."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "When I first came here, it was because I wanted to tell you face to face that I never wanted to see or hear from you again. I wanted my words to hurt you so that you would know how you hurt me."}, {"speaker": "Hiroshi", "text": "I'm sorry."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "But when I saw you, it wasn't anger I felt. It was sadness. You tainted our past and destroyed our future together."}, {"speaker": "Hiroshi", "text": "I want to make amends."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "I'm not sure I'll ever be able to forgive you. But that doesn't mean I shouldn't try."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "I thought we could play some Pai Sho.

Take me back!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Why would I?"}, {"speaker": "Zhu Li", "text": "Because my only mistake was being loyal to the wrong person. I was blindly devoted to Varrick, and I looked past all the times he ridiculed me, or ordered me around , or made me clean his disgusting feet --  --because I thought he possessed the most brilliant mind in the world.

by force! After tensions flared between Su Beifong and her former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Korra brokered a truce, but it was too late. Su and her sons were already on their way to put an end to Kuvira. Meanwhile, Bolin and Varrick learned of Kuvira's true tyrannical intent and deserted her army, but they were captured and betrayed by Zhu Li. Now they're being held against their will!"}, {"speaker": "Wing", "text": "Are you sure this will work? Even without Kuvira, they could still crush us."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Most of this army has been forced into service by Kuvira. If we take her out, they'll have no reason to fight. Tonight  we end her reign of terror."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "She's alone in there. Now's our chance!"}, {"speaker": "Zhu Li", "text": "Don't hurt me!"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Zhu Li?"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "I knew you'd try a sneak attack.  You were afraid to step up and lead the Earth Kingdom when you had the chance.  You were afraid to join me when I became the leader, and now, you're afraid of a fair fight.  You've always been a coward. Take them!"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Korra, you have to go stop Su before she does something terrible."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Stop her, we should be helping her."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "We have no idea where your mom is, or what her plan is. If we go charging into Kuvira's camp, we could get them all captured, or worse. All we can do now is wait."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Attention citizens of Zaofu. Your leader, Su Beifong, attempted to attack me tonight while I slept, ignoring the terms of our truce. Luckily, I now have her and her assault team in custody."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "No."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Rest assured that I will not take revenge on the peaceful citizens of Zaofu, unless your remaining representatives meet me outside the city at dawn to offer the full and unconditional surrender of your city. That is all."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Korra, you can't let Kuvira get away with this! We have to go break out Mom and my brothers!"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "You swore an oath of non-aggression when you became an airbender.  You can't just attack Kuvira!"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "I don't care about the oath! I have to save my family!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No, Jinora is right. Your mom attacked the camp. Kuvira was just defending herself."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "\"Defending herself\"? She was going to attack our city! I can't believe you're refusing to fight!"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Why is that loudspeaker lady talking when I'm trying to sleep ?"}, {"speaker": "Baatar", "text": "Korra, what are we going to do?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Jinora and I will go talk to Kuvira at dawn, and, maybe, we can work something out. I promise, I'll do everything I can to keep the peace."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "I'll go with you."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "We'll go, too."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "No! Dad told us to find Korra, and we did. Now you need to stay safe."}, {"speaker": "Ikki", "text": "Come on! Let us help!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I can't risk anyone else being captured. You can stay with Baatar and Huan while I work things out with Kuvira.  Make sure they get back to Tenzin if anything goes wrong."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Aw, man! When am I gonna see some action ?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Cookie ... jar ... empty. No ... hot ... towels! Waxy ... buildup!  Zhu Li !"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Oh ... she really is gone."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Up and at 'em, Varrick! Time to go to work.  We have another lab set up for you.

I want you to show me how the device works."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "What's goin' on?"}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Go back to sleep. We only need Varrick. You'll need your energy when you get to the re-education camp."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "I can't be expected to work without an assistant! Without Zhu Li, I'm helpless!"}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "One of the guards will be your assistant. I'll be supervising."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Well, I guess he'll be fine.

I wouldn't want to assist me if I were you!"}, {"speaker": "Guard #1", "text": "Maybe we should just let the kid help him out."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Fine. Bolin can assist."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Wait, what? I need my hands!  Uh, hold on! Can we have breakfast first?  While we still have hands?"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Release them now!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "If Su agrees to bow to me and turn over Zaofu, she and the rest of your family will not be harmed."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Never! I'll never bow to you!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "There must be some way for us to resolve this!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "I've already laid out my terms, and I think they're very reasonable. After all, Su did try to take me out during our peaceful negotiations."}, {"speaker": "Wei", "text": "You call bringing an army to threaten our city \"peaceful\"?"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Where's Bolin? I know he would never go along with this!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Bolin is with my fianc\u00e9, working on something very important.  But, I assure you, he's on board with my plans. You two have been apart for some time. I guess you don't realize how much Bolin has grown up.  Now turn over Zaofu ."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I can't just let you take the city!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Avatar Korra, you are interfering with internal Earth Empire business, and letting your personal feelings get in the way of reason. Zaofu cannot continue to rule itself. They have been hoarding their riches and technology too long. I'm here to distribute those resources fairly throughout the nation. This is about equality."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "You don't care about equality! This is about control!  Just take her down! You know it's the right thing to do! You have to stop this!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "The only way you're going to keep me from marching into Zaofu is if you physically stop me. Now what are you going to do?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "It looks like you're not giving me a choice."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Fine.  I want you all to know that I would never ask any of you to do something that I'm not willing to do myself.  So, rather than risk your lives, I will fight the Avatar one-on-one .  Korra, if you win, then you can do whatever you want with Zaofu.  But after I beat you, I want you out of my business for good. I'm the one who brought peace to the Earth Empire, not you . You're not relevant here anymore."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Fine.  You wanna fight the Avatar? Then let's finish this, right here, right now."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Are you really ready to fight her?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Just stay back and let me handle this.  It's been a while,  but I got a lot of pent-up rage."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Don't mess around!  Kuvira is too good! Just go into the Avatar State and get it over with!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No, I'm only going to use that as a last resort."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Be careful."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Use whatever you want: all the elements; the Avatar State; anything you need.  I know you're a little rusty ."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Enough talk!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Looks like the Avatar's a little off her game!"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Don't let her get you frustrated! She wants you to make a mistake!"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Bolin, do the thing."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "What thing?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "The thing ! I never had to tell Zhu Li what thing !"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I'm not Zhu Li, okay? Pretend I don't know anything about anything that's happening here, also pretend I don't want to build a super weapon or get my hands blown off!"}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Walk me through what you're doing. I want to know every detail of your work."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "You know, when I started working with the vines,  the point was to find a clean, unlimited source of energy, not develop some spirity death ray."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Clean energy! Sounds great ! Who doesn't like that stuff? Let's do that instead!"}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Quiet! You're here to help , not talk.  And you of all people, should realize that once a discovery is made, it is our responsibility as scientists  to pursue it as far as we can.  Wherever it leads."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "How would you know? You couldn't discover a wolfbat if it was building a nest in your butt."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "You're pathetic.  Wolfbats don't build nests."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Ooh. You got me there, Dr. Science. You'll never know how it feels to give birth to genius, only to have it kidnapped, and raised by fools !"}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Are you done with your rambling, or do the guards need to encourage you to continue your work?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Okay, okay,  The last time we ran the current through the vine  we couldn't control the power, so I'm trying something new to see if I can direct it."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Come on, Avatar, get up! Show me what you've got!"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "We have to help her!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No! Stay back! I can handle this."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "So I see how the current interacts with the vine, and here is a kind of directional tube, but that is baffling here at the base. It looks like that would only redirect the energy back where it came from. And what's that piece of equipment you're fiddling with now on the power source?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Hand me the ... screw-turn-thingy, would ya?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Ugh, I can't believe you're helping them, you know this isn't right."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Funny story, Bolin. I first got the idea for harnessing spirit power when I watched that giant Unalaq-monster attack the city from my jail cell. That giant monster set me free!  Trust me, kid, I know what I'm doing.  That ought to do it.  Huh.  Okay, stand back.  There we go!"}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "What's that ticking?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "That's the timer."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "The timer for what ?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "For the bomb , of course!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "What?! What bomb?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "The bomb that's gonna explode in five minutes and destroy this entire train, all of the spirit vines, and everything else within a few hundred yards."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "You know what, I'd get out of here if I were you. This is the first time I've built a timer and it might run a little fast. Bolin and I are ready to go down with the ship, or train , in this case, but you seem like you have a lot to live for."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Nononono! I'm not ready to go down with the ship, or the train !"}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "You're bluffing."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Stick around five minutes and you'll find out who's bluffing.  You'll be sorry you left me, Zhu Li! When they write the history books, your name will be synonymous with betrayal ! People will say, \"Hey, what happened to that guy? Oh, didn't you hear? He 'Varricked' himself because some girl 'Zhu Li'd' him!\""}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Enough! What makes you think we would let you blow yourself up? You're working for Kuvira! You don't get to quit.  Grab him."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "You try to pull me away from this thing and I'll hit this remote, and blow it immediately!"}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Why do you have a timer and a remote?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Well, first, I built the timer, but then I thought, you could drag me off the train, so then I built a remote, but then I thought, do I really need the timer, because now I got a remote in my--  Whatever! I'm covering all my bases! The point is, you're leaving, we're staying!"}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "You have to go into the Avatar State! Do it!"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "I don't understand. We got the poison out; what's wrong with her?"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "I knew you were weak."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "You broke our agreement!  Attack!"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Keep them back, I'm calling for help!"}, {"speaker": "Huan", "text": "Stunning work, Ikki. It hurts my eyes with its ... raw, emotional power!  Ugh, pedestrian. I already know what you look like on the outside, I want you to show me, the inner Meelo!"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Help! You have to get Korra and the rest of us out of here now! Hurry!"}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Finally! Let's get it on!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "That's everyone, our half of the train is clear."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "That's good, we're almost out of time."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "You're insane."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "You knew that when you hired me! Bolin, do the thing!  Unhook the cars, oh, come on, that was an easy one!"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Man, that was great! I gotta admit, you had me going there for a while, I really thought you were gonna blow us up! Now, how do we turn this thing off?"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Ooh, we can't turn it off. We're gonna blow up--  --but, we had a pretty good run, right?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "What are you talking about, \"a good run\"? I'm still running! I like running!"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "I'll see you on the other side,  Zhu Li."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I want you to know,  I hate you ."}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "I can't believe he actually blew himself up. That man was crazier than a sewer pipe elephant-rat.  Let's get back to Zaofu."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Yes !  You did it, Bolin, you did the thing !"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I can't believe Zhu Li worked for you as long as she did."}, {"speaker": "Meelo", "text": "Dive, Pepper, dive!  Here comes a hurricane!

If our handsome mugs get recognized trying to go through that checkpoint, we're goners!"}, {"speaker": "Baraz", "text": "If you really are fugitives, you better listen up. We've been scouting this region for days. There's a wall stretching along the entire border and patrols guarding every part of it. That checkpoint is the only way out."}, {"speaker": "Ahnah", "text": "It's not worth the risk, Baraz. How do we know they won't turn us in?"}, {"speaker": "Baraz", "text": "If he wanted us gone, we'd be at the bottom of a pool of lava right now.

I guess I am."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Now that's a breakup!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "After that, I dove into my work. Someone had been taking out supply ships heading to the Southern Water Tribe.  Asami's company was one of the victims, so she and I worked together to catch the perps.  The stakeout was the perfect way to get my mind off Korra. It was an intense night.  Asami and I discovered the triads had double-crossed us.

I'm not giving up on you ."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I know, I know, don't tell me ... I had no right kissing Asami."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "No, actually, I'm completely fine with that.

I didn't want to hurt you all over again.

For real this time."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "After Harmonic Convergence, the world changed. Team Avatar traveled around, searching for new airbenders.

Ladies."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "But then I realized I had to figure out who I was without a lady in my life."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "I know what that's like."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "I mean, to need distance from women.  Because I have so many, all over me, all the time."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Anyway,  I eventually helped Korra defeat Zaheer and save the airbenders.  And we did it as friends. Korra showed me the importance of putting others before myself  and whenever I think of her, she continues to inspire me."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Wow! That story is amazing and I really learned something!"}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "You did? Good."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Yeah! I learned that I really didn't know anything about you! Crazy!  Also, I realized that ladies are complicated. No offense, Grandma."}, {"speaker": "Yin", "text": "None taken."}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "I better just focus on being a better king.

I thought you might be cold out here."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You're so sweet.  Thanks."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Are you okay? You seem out of sorts."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Sorry. I've just been thinking about something Toph said. She told me that the world doesn't need me and it's basically pointless to try and stop Kuvira."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "That's ridiculous."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "At the time, I thought so, too. I figured she was just being her normal, cranky self. But I'm beginning to think she had a point."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "No, she doesn't . The world does need you. You're the Avatar."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "But no matter what I do, the world seems to always be out of balance!  Growing up, I couldn't wait to be the Avatar.

People had hope again and it was all because of you."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "And I was hopeful, too. That feeling didn't last long.  As soon as I defeated Amon, a new enemy took his place.  I can't believe I trusted you. You made me think you wanted to restore balance with the spirits, but this, this isn't balance, it's madness! Now let her go!"}, {"speaker": "Unalaq", "text": "If you want your friend to make it out of the Spirit World, you'll open the other portal now ."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Because of Unalaq, I betrayed Tenzin, opened the portals, and threw the Spirit and human worlds into chaos.  It was my fault he fused with Vaatu and became a Dark Avatar.  And I was helpless to stop him from destroying Raava and cutting off my connection to my past lives.  With Raava gone, Unalaq and Vaatu became more powerful than ever."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "But you became more powerful, too. I mean ... you turned into a giant spirit."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Yeah ... that was pretty awesome."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "And opening the spirit portals turned out to be a good thing.  You brought back the airbenders and caused a positive shift in the world."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Yes,  but Zaheer got airbending too and nearly killed me.  If it weren't for Zaheer,  the Earth Queen would still be alive. There would have been no crisis in the Earth Kingdom  and Kuvira wouldn't be in power.  Things are more out of balance than ever now.

But the important thing is to learn from your enemies and better yourself over time, which you have.  You've changed so much since you first arrived on Air Temple Island. When you first came here, you were hot-headed and a bit selfish.  But you've matured into a thoughtful young woman who puts the needs of others before herself.  The new Air Nation is a testament to that. You sacrificed everything to save them. You're an inspiration to the world."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Thank you both. I know this Kuvira problem is only going to get worse. But no matter what happens, no matter how crazy things get, I'll always try to restore balance."}, {"speaker": "Baraz", "text": "And that's when I made a solemn vow never to eat bark-onion soup again.

Agreed! And I know just how to get rid of her: we tell her she won an all-expense paid vacation to a tropical island. Then, when she gets there, we reveal that it was a trap. The island's a prison!

What's going on here?"}, {"speaker": "Wu", "text": "Oh, hey, Avatar Korra. Just kickin' it world leader-style, trying to figure out what to do about Kuvira.

Their spirits are trapped in the Spirit World."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Let's get them out."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Don't! You'll provoke the vines. Let me try.  They won't open.

No!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "You can't fight me and the poison!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No ...

What's wrong?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "It's Zaheer."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "What are you talking about?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "He's been haunting me ever since I fought him. I can't get any peace. It's like he's blocking me from meditating into the Spirit World."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "I'm here for you. What do you need?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I want to face Zaheer."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Korra, he's too dangerous. Even when he's locked up, he can't be trusted."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I need to if I wanna save Jinora and the others. There's no other way."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "There is another way. I'm calling your father. He can lead an expedition into the Spirit World from the Southern portal."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You've lost faith in me, too, haven't you?  No one thinks I'm capable of anything anymore."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "It's not that at all."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I know I can do this."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I'm just so worried for Jinora. I can't imagine if something happened to you, too."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Tenzin, please. I'll be okay."}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "Zaheer's imprisoned deep in the mountains outside the city. I'll call Raiko and get the clearance."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Pab-pabs, where are you?  Pabu! Oh, I missed you so much!  So, I don't know if you've heard, but Opal's kind of mad at me. I was hoping ... you could help me win her back.  Awesome! Yes, I have an idea."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Hello, Pabu.  Well, it's good to see you, too.  What do you got there?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Opal, you made it!"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "What's this?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "A picnic, just for the two of us! Well, the three of us. Sorry, Pabs."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "So, this note Pabu brought me saying you broke both of your legs was just a ruse?"}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Maybe ... but now that you're here, don't you want to just sit back, relax, try some of my homemade steam buns  \u2014Pema's recipe\u2014and watch Pabu do some of his world-famous backflips for entertainment? Ha-hah!"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Oh. Steam buns. My favorite. This will totally make me forget that you worked for Kuvira, the person who captured my family and is probably torturing them right now. So yeah, let's just sit down and have a great picnic because we're so in love!  I'm sorry you had to see that, Pabu."}, {"speaker": "Raiko", "text": "Thank you both for coming."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "It's nice to be welcomed back with open arms."}, {"speaker": "Raiko", "text": "Actually, I brought you here out of necessity. It's no secret I never liked you. Especially after you tried to have me kidnapped."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "Allegedly."}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Right. Everything you do is \"allegedly\". Like when you took over my company and bombed the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center!"}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "I own that building! A man has a right to blow up his own property!"}, {"speaker": "Raiko", "text": "Right now, I need you to put aside your differences. If Kuvira really is creating a super weapon, we're going to need the two brightest minds in the city working together to stop it."}, {"speaker": "Varrick", "text": "What do you say, Asami?  Partners again?"}, {"speaker": "Asami", "text": "Fine. I'll help.  But don't even think about double-crossing me again."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Are you sure you're ready for this?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Yes. I think if I see Zaheer chained up, I'll finally realize that he's not a threat anymore."}, {"speaker": "White Lotus guard", "text": "Approach the wall."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No. I need to do this alone."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "I figured you would show up sooner or later. So ... you must really be in trouble if you came all the way down here to see me."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I came here to look you in the eye and tell you that you have no power over me. I will no longer be scared of you."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "I guess it didn't work. You still seem scared."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "This was a mistake."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "I know why you're here."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You don't know anything about me!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "You can't go into the Spirit World. I spend most of my time in the Spirit World and it's well known that the Avatar's spirit hasn't been there for a few years."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "You can meditate into the Spirit World from here ? Doesn't feel very spiritually charged."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "This is your problem. Republic City is flowing with spiritual energy and you can't even tap into it."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No, my problem is you! You poisoned me! You've ruined me! People used to think I was unstoppable, but now they don't think I'm capable of anything!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Blaming me is a crutch to make you feel better, but it's not helping you recover."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I thought seeing you face-to-face would put an end to all of this. But maybe it's time I realize I'll never be the same."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Neither of us are the same as before. I learned to fly, but now I'm bound in chains. You have all the power in the world and the freedom to use it, but you choose to hold yourself down."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I'm not holding myself down, but my powers have limits!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "You're wrong. That poison should've killed you, but you were able to fight it off. You think your power has limits; I say, it's limitless."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Whatever. Before , you were always talking about chaos and freedom. Then you took out the Earth Queen and created the worst dictator the Earth Kingdom has ever seen. Thanks for that!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "I've heard rumors about her, but I didn't know she achieved so much power. She needs to be stopped."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Well, I can't stop her unless I get over this block."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "I think I can help. Let me lead you into the Spirit World."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No way. I can't trust you."}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Maybe not. But if you had any other options, you wouldn't be here now, would you? We may have been enemies once, but for now, our interests align."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I've come this far. What have I got to lose?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Focus on the sound of my voice and clear your mind.  Let it play out."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I can't!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "You can. Accept what happened to you. Don't fear what might have been."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I have no control!"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "Don't be afraid. Hold on!"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I made it ... and you led me here. Do you know where Jinora and the others are?"}, {"speaker": "Zaheer", "text": "No, but you do."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Raava, I missed you. Where have you been?"}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "I have always been inside of you."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Can you help me find Jinora?  How do I release their spirits?"}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "You must bend the energy within."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "But I'm powerless in the Spirit World."}, {"speaker": "Raava", "text": "No. You're most powerful here. In the Spirit World, you're connected to all the spiritual energy."}, {"speaker": "Ryu", "text": "Ugh ... I feel all spirity."}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Dad!"}, {"speaker": "Tenzin", "text": "I'm so glad you're safe. What happened? How did you get out?"}, {"speaker": "Jinora", "text": "Korra saved us."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "So ... how are you doing?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I feel ... whole again. I feel good."}, {"speaker": "Mako", "text": "Do you think you're finally able to forget about what Zaheer did to you?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "No. But I am finally able to accept what happened and I think that's gonna make me stronger."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Where are you going?"}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "We've got some family business to take care of."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "All right, listen. Before you go, I just want to tell you that I understand how you feel. I know there is nothing I could do or no big gesture that could make up for all my mistakes, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop trying to win you back because ... I love you."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Thanks for saying all of that.  You know ... there is one thing you could do to win me back."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "What is it?

Why can't you harvest the vines?"}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "I won't do that.

If she takes that to Republic City, it could obliterate everything."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "I didn't come to fight with Kuvira or destroy a cannon. I'm here to save my family.  It will take everything we have just to get out alive."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Hmm. Kuvira wants every single one of her people to see the weapon test tomorrow, so the factory will be mostly empty then. That's our best chance to sneak in and free Su without being spotted."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Good thinking, Bolin."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "Thanks.  I kind of have a headache now."}, {"speaker": "Korra", "text": "Excuse me, spirit? Can I talk to ...  and you're gone.  Just like all the other spirits.  They're abandoning the city."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "So let me ask you about metalbending. Su tried to teach me, but I couldn't get the hang of it."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "I used to have an academy to train metalbending.

It's a very rare ability.  Maybe you do have some talent."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I can't believe ... you think I'm talented?

I'm blind, not deaf."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "So here's something I've always been curious about: Who's Lin's dad?"}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "He was a guy named Kanto. Nice man, but it didn't really work out between us."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "And ...  okay."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Lin, I can feel your enraged breathing from here. Just say what you have to say and let's get it over with."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Just get it over with? Yeah, let's not linger on the fact that I grew up without a dad. No need to get all touchy-feely about it. Just one of those things, right?"}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "Hey, I forgave you for all your garbage a long time ago and Su and I worked things out.  You're the only one who wants to hold on to this family drama nonsense  for the rest of your life."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Forgave me for what?!  And not knowing my dad is nonsense to you?  It was pretty important to me.  And until now, you would never even discuss it. You know, after Su and I patched things up, I thought, \"maybe I should try to reach out to mom.\"  But now that we're together again, I remember why we stopped talking.  You make me furious  and you don't even know why. And when I tell you, you don't care.  Once we save Su, you and I are finished."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "If that's your decision and it makes you happy, then fine."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "The test is about to start. They're going to blow up that empty town we flew over yesterday.  You're clear to go."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Copy that.  We're clear to go."}, {"speaker": "Toph", "text": "The guards are on the other side of that door.  We'll have to be quiet."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Shoot me over to the cage  and I can swing them back on my cable.  Bolin, you'll have to catch them since mom won't be able to see them.  Ready?"}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "We'll get you out one at a time. Come on."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "I got you!"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Congratulations on all of your hard work.  This weapon is proof that the Earth Empire is the strongest nation in the world. And believe me, this is only the beginning!  Fire the weapon."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "What's wrong?"}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Probably something minor.  I should be able to find the problem.  The distributor pin is gone.  I swear I locked it in place yesterday. There's no way it could have just fallen out."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "And this could cause the entire weapon to fail?"}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "It could cause it to explode."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "What do you know about this?"}, {"speaker": "Zhu Li", "text": "Nothing."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "You swore your loyalty to me and I gave you a chance at greatness.  This is how you repay me?!"}, {"speaker": "Zhu Li", "text": "You're a monster. I regret nothing."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "Chain her up in the target town. She can see how the weapon works  up close and personal."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Oh, no."}, {"speaker": "Suyin", "text": "Sweetie, it'll be fine. Lin won't drop you and Bolin will catch you."}, {"speaker": "Baatar", "text": "No, no. Just go. Just leave me. I'll stay here."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Sorry, but I have to do this."}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "The prison. Get there now!"}, {"speaker": "Baatar Jr.", "text": "Should we postpone the test?"}, {"speaker": "Kuvira", "text": "I didn't come all this way to stop now. Fire when ready. I want to see that town destroyed."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "We got 'em. We're coming out."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Mom! Dad!  Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lin", "text": "Let's move."}, {"speaker": "Opal", "text": "Kuvira caught Zhu Li and threw her in the town."}, {"speaker": "Bolin", "text": "What?
