Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko  transformed the Fire Nation colonies into the United Republic of Nations,  a society where benders and nonbenders from all over the world could live and thrive together in peace and harmony.  They named the capital of this great land, Republic City.  Avatar Aang accomplished many remarkable things in his life.  But sadly, his time in this world came to an end. And like the cycle of the seasons, the cycle of the Avatar began anew."

I've been forced to hide behind a mask ever since.  As you know, the Avatar has recently arrived in Republic City.  And if she were here,  she would tell you that bending brings balance to the world. But, she is wrong. The only thing bending has brought to the world, is suffering.  It has been the cause of every war in every era.  But that is about to change.  I know you have been wondering, \"What is the Revelation?\"  You are about to get your answer.  Since the beginning of time,  the spirits have acted as guardians of our world, and they have spoken to me.  They say the Avatar has failed humanity.  That is why the spirits have chosen me to usher in a new era of balance. They have granted me a power  that will make Equality a reality. The power to take a person's bending away.  Permanently."

Humans can now physically enter the Spirit World, and spirits will be free to roam our world. I will no longer be the bridge. Humans and spirits must learn to live together. My mission will always be to use Raava's light spirit to guide the world toward peace and balance. Harmonic Convergence has caused a shift in the planet's energy. I can feel it.

When the existence of our people was threatened, when the Avatar's life hung in the balance, Jinora never gave up hope. Thanks to her leadership, I see a very bright future for the Air Nation. Of course, there would be no Air Nation without Avatar Korra: she opened the portals and somehow the world began anew for us. And she was even willing to lay down her own life in order to protect ours. There's no way we can ever repay her for all she's done. But we can follow her example of service and sacrifice. So while she recuperates, the Air Nation will reclaim its nomadic roots and roam the earth.  But unlike our ancestors, we will serve people of all nations, working wherever there is corruption and discord to restore balance and peace. Avatar Korra, I vow that we will do everything in our power to follow in your footsteps and bring harmony to the world.  Now, let us anoint the master who will help lead us in our new path."

Maybe that's the name of the bad guys, \"Terror Square\"!  What about \"Legion of Darkness\"? Well, we'll put a focus group on it.  Bolin teaches the airbenders to create a giant tornado.  Then he flies around in the sky,  pushes Zaheer into it,  turning him into wind, forever ! But Bolin doesn't realize that the Universal Interplanetary Combination Zero-Hour\u2014talk about a ticking clock\u2014is almost upon him!  And when Juji shoots his laser eyes at the evil Unalaq,  the beams accidentally fly into the magic spirit doorway!  They bounce off Vaatu, setting him free,  and hit Bolin, turning him into a giant !  But when Vaatu is set free, the evil Unalaq, who has always been an annoyingly clingy person, is so close to Vaatu that they combine into one horrifying monster!  Giant Bolin and the evil UnaVaatu fight toe-to-toe, zapping each other with their laser beams as they stomp around Republic City!  It looks like the evil UnaVaatu might win !  But thankfully, Bolin's spiritual mojo is so strong that he attracts the queen of the fairies !  With her help, Bolin turns UnaVaatu into magic dust and sprays him into the sky.  And that's where the stars come from.  Oh yeah, and he turns into a dragon and he goes into the Spirit World and he saves the Avatar.  The end!"
